6,strange images passed through my mind
7,the sheep had taught him that
8,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
9,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
10,your son went to serve at a distant place and became a centurion
11,they made the boy continue digging but he found nothing

13,the shower's in there
14,follow the instructions here
15,they're calling to us not to give up and to keep on fighting
16,the shop is closed on mondays
17,even coming down on the train together she wrote me
18,i'm going away he said
19,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
20,i'm going into the desert the man answered turning back to his reading
21,he wasn't asking for help
22,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
23,everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
24,i'd like to think
25,the alchemist probably already knew all that
26,you'll take fifty and like it
27,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
28,what's your name he asked
29,it's because you were not born
30,what do you think of that
31,if i had told you you wouldn't have seen the pyramids
32,i haven't heard the baby complain yet
33,i told him we could teach her to ignore people who waste her time
34,the one you're blocking
35,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
36,he didn't need to seek out the old woman for this
37,only a minority of literature is written this way
38,i wish you wouldn't
39,nature knows me as the wisest being in creation the sun said
40,there is only one way to learn the alchemist answered
41,don't do it for me
42,i'm not working for any other paper
43,that's not so bad
44,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
45,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
46,the boy looked out at the horizon
47,never mind about that
48,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
49,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
50,i make my living forecasting the future for people he said
51,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
52,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
53,of course the two were unable to do anything
54,all they think about is food and water
55,shakespeare never said that
56,you need to see this
57,the boy knew a lot of people in the city
58,frank was dying so they were forced to leave him
59,this is no place for you
60,the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
61,don't point the gun at me
62,he's the man the ads are written for
63,there was no excuse for goodman to fly off the handle
64,that day the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display
65,i told you to have the ice box fixed
66,it's late in the evening a perfect time for coffee
67,i'm coming fatima he said
68,don't do it for me
69,i'm sure i don't know what you're talking about
70,he felt invisible among all those young people
71,he thought of all the married shepherds he had known
72,you mean spies and things like that
73,but finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear four sheep
74,i just got rid of one crowd
75,every search begins with beginner's luck
76,you can't be the wind the wind said
77,he had surprised himself with the thought
78,he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
79,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
80,most meteorites are more or less rounded
81,it's candice now on long distance from washington
82,he could always go back to being a shepherd
83,the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
84,do you know what
85,they went in to drink the tea which was served in beautiful crystal glasses
86,this is for you
87,they were men of the desert and they were fearful of sorcerers
88,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
89,it seemed so safe and tranquil
90,aren't you going to tell me
91,that's true the boy thought
92,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
93,during one of these conversations the driver told of his own life
94,isn't the party also to announce his engagement to joanna
95,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
96,i heard a faint movement under my feet
97,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
98,even then he hardly understood what this meant
99,it looked like a rusty gas float
100,it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
101,all they think about is food and water
102,after the dictator's rule of fourty three years was over the country was devastated
103,only when he consents
104,the camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing the sunset
105,all they ever do really is look for food and water
106,sure you don't want me to go in with you
107,i want it as soon as possible
108,it looked like a rusty gas float
109,some storms are worth the wreckage
110,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
111,modern sewing machines can throttle their speed
112,it's as much my fault as yours
113,image registration could be easily incorporated into lowpower embedded devices
114,the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
115,you don't deny that
116,they made the boy continue digging but he found nothing
117,then he sat in the sunfilled doorway smoking the hookah
118,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
119,it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
120,all things are one the boy thought
121,i can't let you have my plane
122,if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
123,he put his headcloth in place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin
124,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
125,the englishman asked if they were in danger
126,sun is better than rain
127,the boy was strong and wanted to retaliate but he was in a foreign country
128,yet it was a little too large for assurance
129,it's the master work of the alchemists
130,they went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set
131,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
132,from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
133,the burning fire had been extinguished
134,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
135,sometimes i get so mad at you i can't see straight
136,on our way to san francisco we were listening to reggae music and smoking weed
137,work for somebody else
138,many of our soldiers teamed up
139,am i going to find my treasure he asked
140,helium makes your voice high pitched
141,it was faintly marked with transverse stripes and slightly flattened from the perfect round
142,the boy closed his book
143,you mean the one who drank so much
144,this is no place for you
145,mrs sarah doesn't either
146,his expression reminded me of a horse chewing hay
147,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
148,naturally we have to do something about it
149,make sure you've read my introductory post on voice coding since we will be building upon that
150,he told fatima that at their next meeting
151,everyone seemed very excited
152,maybe the water was too hot
153,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
154,he really was a king a wise king
155,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
156,he needs three days answered the alchemist
157,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
158,it was the first time either had touched the other
159,i'm leaving right now
160,then connect to localhost within windows
161,and he wasn't faring much better
162,the boy closed his book
163,i don't understand what you're talking about the desert said
164,the chair lift took them up the mountain
165,somebody had returned my lost credit card to the bank
166,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
167,that doesn't say much for mine
168,don't give in to your fears said the alchemist in a strangely gentle voice
169,just handling them made him feel better
170,how am i going to live until the bank opens
171,liz put the flowers into a mirrored vase
172,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
173,promise you'll never lie the way snoopy did
174,there is no wine in this country the young man said
175,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
176,then she took both of his hands in hers and began quietly to pray
177,you'd think i was on the witness stand
178,the emerald tablet is a direct passage to the soul of the world
179,i've already told you
180,this is for you
181,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
182,just give me a few hours before you make any decisions
183,and the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived
184,in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
185,one is loved because one is loved
186,they mounted their horses
187,even then he hardly understood what this meant
188,i'd hate to have that many pins stuck in me
189,i met a man with sharp nails
190,only the lights in the great tent remained
191,apparently it's the dumplings that make this stew taste so good
192,when she saw the unknown object bobbing up and down the edge she was absolutely horrified
193,i have known true alchemists the alchemist continued
194,he really was a king a wise king
195,what are these things he asked
196,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
197,i never saw it before
198,i'm proud of it
199,the boy was embarrassed and confessed that he had observed nothing
200,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
201,he left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant
202,a boy came running towards me
203,a fine bunch of reporters
204,the boy was startled
205,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
206,everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him his heart said
207,it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
208,what about this job
209,what is an alchemist he asked finally
210,and their eyes spoke of death
211,the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
212,he recited an our father silently
213,i'm going to find kyle's mother
214,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
215,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
216,give it to me
217,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
218,the sunset faded into twilight before anything else happened
219,the boy began to dig into the dune
220,this is what was written on the emerald tablet said the alchemist when he had finished
221,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
222,an army is coming the boy said
223,i noticed that the boy answered
224,the boy was getting irritated
225,you will never be able to escape from your heart
226,the first day passed
227,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
228,i don't know what she's talking about
229,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
230,but his heart was speaking of other things
231,what if you can't stand him
232,they were strange books
233,brent's opening attack on the governor
234,i've actually fallen in love with him
235,did you actually give tamara that gun
236,i'm smoking too much
237,i know you're unhappy
238,others stumbled upon the stone by accident
239,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
240,the englishman said nothing
241,because we're the people and we're tough
242,and he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals
243,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
244,jupiter has a great red spot
245,then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
246,i haven't any watch
247,you mean you and me
248,then where is your gun
249,and one can always come back
250,this biscuit is yummy
251,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
252,the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
253,many telescopes were pointed at it
254,those are the rules of war the leader explained
255,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
256,the boy was shocked
257,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
258,the night was warm and i was thirsty
259,calibration complete
260,she refilled her vessel and left
261,that brings you good luck for ten years
262,the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
263,you can hear out of it
264,no matter what happens it's a nice vote of confidence you're getting from your boss
265,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
266,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
267,when the sun sets the men will once again surrender their arms to me
268,he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
269,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
270,the boy remembered an old proverb from his country
271,raisins are delicious
272,finally after hours of waiting the guard bade the boy enter
273,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
274,although everything should be under the state's control there is a lot of violence in prisons
275,hunches his mother used to call them
276,he was planning as he left the bar
277,i get thirty dollars a week
278,did she discuss it with you
279,the cottage burned down
280,i am here the boy said
281,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
282,i was impatient to see it opened
283,the path through the forest was unlit and scary
284,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
285,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
286,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
287,he suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours
288,a drought hit western europe
289,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
290,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
291,i say we don't go out any more
292,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
293,they're only made of rock crystal and there are millions of rock crystals in the earth
294,he was able to get on his knees but he quickly slipped back
295,ten years at the university and here i am in a corral
296,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
297,from then on he would make his own decisions
298,the scabbard was embossed in silver and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones
299,a touch of colic
300,strange images passed through my mind
301,i should thank you
302,i was wondering if you would work on this project with me because i cant find anyone else
303,that night he told all of this to the alchemist
304,the stranger placed his sword in its scabbard and the boy relaxed
305,another who was searching the boy's bags found the piece of gold
306,they said nothing else
307,but she said nothing
308,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
309,and i told harry i thought i'd be bored to death
310,and i still claim i was right the night i proposed
311,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
312,i had never heard of alchemists before the boy said
313,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
314,this is what was written on the emerald tablet said the alchemist when he had finished
315,henderson was taking it in
316,he got up early with the idea of finding it
317,the giraffe had become fearful
318,it's still sopping wet
319,and also by unhappiness envy and jealousy
320,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
321,some went away while i was there and other people came
322,with a bag of marshmallows
323,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
324,i want those stamps
325,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
326,it was shredded like lace after an attack from hyperactive kittens
327,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
328,now the moon's out
329,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
330,but i'll make you and maria a business proposition
331,i got it all ready
332,i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance
333,the city was still sleeping
334,it was rising slowly and painfully out of the cylinder
335,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
336,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
337,i didn't find the blowdryer so i just used the vacuumcleaner
338,i won't shut up
339,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
340,i could die happily and that made me feel good
341,that sobered him a little
342,and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
343,it was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy's soul had
344,they're not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia
345,there was absolutely no reason for her to announce it to the entire company
346,she wasn't her type
347,the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
348,but why do you want a divorce
349,there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
350,can you hear me
351,yes that's what love is
352,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
353,what do you make of him
354,they placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses
355,now i too will be one of the women who wait
356,before the sun had reached its high point five hundred tribesmen appeared on the horizon
357,others stumbled upon the stone by accident
358,what's all this mess
359,but now i'm sad and alone
360,he asked it please never to stop speaking to him
361,when you are loved you can do anything in creation
362,the guitar broke and she couldn't play anymore
363,who do you feel is responsible for that
364,do you have any secret hiding place here in the house
365,they were on the right track
366,i was scared but wasted no time in going out and crossing the bridge to the sand pits
367,i'm crazy about adrian
368,he was sure the girl would never understand
369,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
370,the thought was so dreadful to him that he forgot about the heat and went forward
371,the alchemist dismounted slowly and the boy did the same
372,he started to read the book he had bought
373,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
374,one key is for encryption the other one for decryption
375,he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
376,maybe she didn't even remember him
377,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
378,better get a pencil out and write it down
379,visiting a university offers great chances for your career
380,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
381,this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
382,his seat was unstable
383,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
384,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
385,i don't know what she's talking about
386,i shall make us some ice cubes
387,how does slacker robbie feel about that
388,the war is going to end someday the girl said
389,i had a momentary impulse to go back and help him but i was too scared to do anything
390,strange images passed through my mind
391,is winged victory showing anywhere in one minute
392,and ask for a glass of wine for me
393,i don't think i follow you
394,and the girl pointed to the south indicating that it was there the strange man lived
395,can i help you asked the man behind the window
396,something terribly important's happened
397,everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
398,where was his horse
399,you know where i can get it
400,you're sure you don't mind
401,it is the most valuable stamp in the world
402,and one or two persons were returning
403,everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him his heart said
404,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
405,then the thing came upon him in a flash
406,it was the pure language of the world
407,he knew how to shear them and how to slaughter them
408,he decided to spend the night there
409,the boy was shocked
410,the boy was getting irritated
411,whenever he saw the sea or a fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force
412,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
413,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
414,i myself heard nothing of that
415,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
416,and he wasn't faring much better
417,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
418,when the simum ceased to blow everyone looked to the place where the boy had been
419,the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
420,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
421,it seemed as if what the old king had called beginner's luck were no longer functioning
422,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
423,and to do that you need money
424,you should see his fan mail
425,a drought hit western europe
426,i get more of a kick out of it that way
427,that's all you are
428,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
429,everyone should have health insurance
430,we're just slowly plodding through some user interviews at the moment
431,nearby was the englishman reading a book
432,i won a flower
433,where do you live
434,my review of the sun one star
435,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
436,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
437,i want to see the chieftains
438,i could have helped her
439,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
440,the boy went to look for the englishman
441,it was the old man who spoke first
442,i'm not going to charge you anything now she said
443,people say strange things the boy thought
444,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
445,there was very little talking
446,and in that way the months passed
447,to nourish the falcon
448,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
449,it's awfully clear now
450,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
451,this is keith miller
452,the war is going to end someday the girl said
453,the sheep had taught him that
454,what's your name he asked
455,the pink love heart keyring glowed
456,they set off running wildly into the trees
457,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
458,it looked like a rusty gas float
459,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
460,can i get a woot woot
461,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
462,one night the father had a dream
463,the boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things
464,the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
465,i should have been there
466,don't ask me why i don't know why
467,this is the first phase of the job he said
468,since then i haven't been able to get another one
469,this is a very interesting situation
470,you certainly delivered the goods
471,this is christmas eve
472,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
473,how did you find out
474,the alchemist lighted the fire and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent
475,they ate in silence
476,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
477,they returned to the gates of the monastery
478,the old man was probably a gypsy too
479,and it knew nothing about love
480,i'm going to them
481,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
482,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
483,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
484,we'll have something to drink and eat these hawks
485,never stop dreaming the old king had said
486,he paused and his eyes were still unfriendly
487,until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
488,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
489,and they had understood each other perfectly well
490,do you know that i threw it away
491,another trick the boy thought
492,you're playing with dynamite
493,then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
494,are you coming tomorrow
495,since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
496,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
497,i've got indigestion
498,he is going to transform himself into the wind just to demonstrate his powers
499,it's going to take a while the boy said
500,listen don't believe what he says
501,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
502,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
503,the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
504,she used her microscope to inspect it
505,will you get close to him
506,are there any other questions
507,it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
508,did you get the mayor
509,they said nothing else
510,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
511,it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
512,why do you want to find that sort of person the arab asked
513,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
514,he'll be ready on time
515,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
516,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
517,except for the dream
518,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
519,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
520,i sold crystal and crossed the desert
521,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
522,so you got married
523,i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
524,in any case it's good that you've learned that everything in life has its price
525,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
526,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
527,the camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing the sunset
528,he instead offers an alternate explanation that relates to site scalability issues
529,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
530,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
531,she placed the glass carefully on the edge of the table
532,because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
533,i can send contextual information to it from other apps
534,everyone seemed very excited
535,why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
536,she wasn't her type
537,i'll have it in a minute
538,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
539,you can hear out of it
540,but she said nothing
541,i think i found something
542,and then there were the others who were interested only in gold
543,may i go in and see him
544,it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
545,what do you mean by that
546,maybe that's why they came
547,i know that girl
548,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
549,it's a private club for only the most respectable people
550,we migrated our stuff from mac os to linux
551,too much food is being wasted
552,other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs
553,you got someplace to sleep
554,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
555,but that was simply because my eye was tired
556,but none of that is from the pyramids said the alchemist
557,that insane android continues to ignore me
558,but then he stopped
559,what is love the desert asked
560,better bring me a glass of milk
561,are you sure this is claire
562,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
563,some storms are worth the wreckage
564,she spoke swedish he spoke spanish
565,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
566,do not do tomorrow what you could do today
567,so what do you want of me the sun asked
568,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
569,the boy spent a sleepless night
570,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
571,it's like the flight of those two hawks it can't be understood by reason alone
572,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
573,is this the ear you can't hear on
574,during one of these conversations the driver told of his own life
575,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
576,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
577,you'll live and you'll learn that a man shouldn't be so stupid
578,it was a mega monster made of metal
579,what have you got to report
580,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
581,go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
582,a lot of patience but shepherds know all about patience
583,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
584,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
585,even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year
586,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
587,he's doing it because it's what he wants to do
588,and one or two persons were returning
589,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
590,well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
591,maybe she didn't even remember him
592,he didn't want any conversation at this point
593,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
594,first they tried to find him on their own
595,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
596,how could you even think that
597,jackson was glad that he'd wore kevlar that morning
598,the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
599,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
600,the boy was startled
601,the camel driver though seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war
602,maybe that's why they give up on it so early too
603,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
604,he took out his money and counted it
605,this is unfair
606,the relief on her face showed that she understood
607,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
608,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
609,but i'd like to see the castles in the towns where they live the boy explained
610,i knows i'm a luxury
611,most meteorites are more or less rounded
612,maybe she didn't even remember him
613,once to the thief and once to the general
614,i want to see him do it said the chief
615,and then he perceived it very slowly
616,so how will we name all these hurricanes
617,but the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom
618,amy's a genius at research
619,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
620,but he decided to take a chance
621,they always do that
622,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
623,they placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses
624,the drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels
625,no that's not what i mean
626,maybe it was because they moved around so much
627,after two hours he returned to the room where the wise man was
628,i think it's about bird hunting but now i can see how that might be misinterpreted
629,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
630,when talking to someone who has just started to learn the language its good to speak slowly and clearly
631,he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
632,the wind began to pick up
633,that's the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
634,then came the night of the first falling star
635,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
636,is that screwball pitpat still around
637,love required them to stay with the people they loved
638,he's in the insurance business
639,it was repetitious but soothing
640,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
641,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
642,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
643,so now i fear nothing because it was those omens that brought you to me
644,i'm the leader of the caravan said a darkeyed bearded man
645,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
646,he had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said
647,two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop
648,i don't want any plastics
649,this puts me in a peculiar hole
650,i'm going to tell your mother on you
651,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
652,i don't want anything else in life
653,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
654,the boy began again to read his book but he was no longer able to concentrate
655,after all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places
656,take your paws off me
657,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
658,you've got to do something
659,but he appeared to be unaware of any danger
660,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
661,next morning there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at al fayoum
662,don't you know that girl's very sick
663,and at that i told him and he took my place
664,spain is producing lots of lettuce paprika and tomatoes
665,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
666,you put something wrong in those capsules
667,he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
668,he knew he was stronger than his friend
669,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
670,it's the only one they had left
671,they reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held
672,how do people celebrate good weather over there
673,there was a thud like the fall of a great mass
674,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
675,don't say anything fatima interrupted
676,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
677,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
678,except for my ulcers
679,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
680,when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
681,taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
682,and then he would ask us to go back to our easels and replicate all the techniques in one go
683,but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
684,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
685,they didn't have the printing press in those days the boy argued
686,he won't leave the circle
687,it looked like a rusty gas float
688,but everyone and his aunt lilian's been through that bag
689,i got it all ready
690,all things are one the old man had said
691,the boy turned to the hand that wrote all
692,i looked at the cylinder again and was completely terrified
693,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
694,those gypsies are really smart he thought
695,it isn't the money
696,if he abandons that pursuit it's because it wasn't truelove
697,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
698,he could sell the stones and buy a return ticket
699,not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to
700,now what are you going to do
701,that's true the boy thought
702,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
703,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
704,now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
705,today i understand something i didn't see before every blessing ignored becomes a curse
706,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
707,then whose is it
708,two horsemen waiting ahead of them
709,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
710,who wrote that speech for you
711,the article should discuss possible approaches to image registration
712,maybe we're all that way the boy mused
713,but they were not there
714,now i too will be one of the women who wait
715,it's easy and yet i've never done it before he thought
716,i think maybe you'd better
717,see if we can move it
718,now his intuition was that he had been right in coming
719,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
720,it's just that i never have
721,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
722,and then he perceived it very slowly
723,you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
724,all i saw was an army said the boy
725,the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
726,all things are one the boy thought
727,almost everyone here speaks spanish
728,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
729,it was a a kind of fascination that paralysed my actions
730,they're always after me for interviews
731,what good is money to you if you're going to die
732,advancing slowly they searched among the stones
733,an alchemist said the alchemist
734,was the doctor here
735,put jackie right on the staff
736,she wants to send you on a lecture tour
737,but as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
738,because you have already lost your savings twice
739,the dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on
740,i didn't know shepherds knew how to read said a girl's voice behind him
741,i learned how to care for sheep and i haven't forgotten how that's done
742,i was impatient to see it opened
743,to nourish the falcon
744,the little group of people from the city dispersed
745,why didn't you tell me
746,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
747,learn to recognize omens and follow them the old king had said
748,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
749,but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
750,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
751,maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
752,they worked from early morning till late evening
753,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
754,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
755,the alchemist turned to the boy
756,then the two went off to have some more tea
757,the alchemist probably already knew all that
758,that's an inherent disadvantage
759,i can only tell you what i saw
760,he really was a king a wise king
761,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
762,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
763,i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
764,a practice of infidels he said to himself
765,he was older and was carrying a small bucket
766,the boy took out urim and thummim from his bag
767,the fine manufacturing company was a bookkeeper for fourteen years
768,that's a lot of hooey
769,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
770,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
771,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
772,you can't do that
773,we need to be confident all of us he proposed a solution
774,make you're a hero sure as you're born
775,most meteorites are more or less rounded
776,finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
777,the area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view
778,the englishman was disappointed
779,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
780,he carried two dead hawks over his shoulder
781,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
782,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
783,then why should they be surprised when they see one
784,the ranger took his rifle and went into the forest to shoot the bear
785,why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
786,the alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy's cup
787,neither the radar nor the other instruments detected the stealth bomber
788,it reminded him of the wool from his sheep
789,you're not asking a favor of him
790,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
791,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
792,so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
793,at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
794,he rose and made his way back toward the palm trees
795,i have never seen a rothschild before
796,that makes sense the alchemist answered
797,the boy looked out at the horizon
798,i didn't frisk him
799,it was just that he couldn't grasp what it meant
800,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
801,that was his work
802,she's going to lose her mind when she finds out
803,something older than humanity more ancient than the desert
804,keep me here until i get over it
805,the boys'll be coming back to phone
806,the scottish parliament contains politicians
807,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
808,that night he told all of this to the alchemist
809,i'm talking about the building and loan
810,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
811,the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
812,maktub thought the boy
813,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
814,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
815,business has really improved he said to the boy after the customer had left
816,the shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon
817,but he kept the sword in his hand
818,the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
819,i have to separate out the sulfur
820,come on in here now
821,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
822,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
823,he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
824,but everything had changed
825,the hand with the whip pointed to the south
826,i got ways of making them talk
827,when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
828,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
829,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
830,i wouldn't live in it as a ghost
831,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
832,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
833,and also because i know about the soul of the world he thought to himself
834,the omens had told him so
835,the pink love heart keyring glowed
836,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
837,it looked like a rusty gas float
838,i forgot my hat
839,you knew the whole story
840,i like cyndi wayne
841,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
842,work has been rough in the last few months because of a major project launch
843,the boy watched the exchange with fascination
844,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
845,he told her about the morning's meeting
846,those are the rules of war the leader explained
847,but his heart was speaking of other things
848,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
849,they locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold had
850,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
851,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
852,then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
853,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
854,the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
855,and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
856,even then he hardly understood what this meant
857,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
858,i'm hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
859,there was a full moon and the boy told the englishman the story of his life
860,they were strange books
861,the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
862,he got up early with the idea of finding it
863,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
864,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
865,but i was also stumbling because i couldnt look away from these things
866,there's millions of ways
867,what do i do in salem the old man laughed
868,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
869,there are rumors of tribal wars he told them
870,even if you're an expert reading all of it is often not feasible due to lack of time
871,robin had some sort of date with tracy
872,the woman said she had never heard of such a person and hurried away
873,modern sewing machines can throttle their speed
874,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
875,you can't say that about my father
876,the streamer of gas came out towards us
877,the usage of high information content is meaningless
878,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
879,but the crystal merchant had no choice
880,instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boy's forehead
881,you don't know scott
882,but maybe i'll never have another chance to get to the pyramids in egypt
883,always heed the omens the old king had said
884,and this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts
885,so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
886,like crickets and like expectations like lizards and fourleaf clovers
887,he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
888,that's not my money
889,is he really supposed to read that many books on philosophy
890,i get thirty dollars a week
891,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
892,and it knew nothing about love
893,oh its not such a big deal right away
894,and then he perceived it very slowly
895,the boy closed his book
896,however the article is written poorly and incomprehensibly
897,the microphone put out a muffled signal
898,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
899,i'm afraid you're blocking my view
900,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
901,maybe we're all that way the boy mused
902,they walked in from the rain all dishevelled and steaming
903,he could always become a crystal salesman again
904,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
905,i sold crystal and crossed the desert
906,the ladder of the fire truck was not long enough
907,is she coming back here
908,they called it the simum and it was worse than a storm at sea
909,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
910,when you are loved you can do anything in creation
911,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
912,we're all excited around here
913,there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
914,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
915,the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
916,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
917,then the two went off to have some more tea
918,i'll keep you in mind
919,on the third day the chief met with his officers
920,so what do you want of me the sun asked
921,its easier to endure the cold if you have a warm drink in the belly
922,don't hurt my sore arm again
923,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
924,there were mountains in the distance
925,thomas went to war
926,it's a private club for only the most respectable people
927,that sobered him a little
928,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
929,always ask an objective question
930,why do they need gin
931,all i saw was an army said the boy
932,what do you want here today the desert asked him
933,melissa's phone kept vibrating uncontrollably
934,as they browsed the store together
935,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
936,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
937,during one of these conversations the driver told of his own life
938,gimme the receiving room
939,prefetching is used to avoid cache misses
940,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
941,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
942,raisins are delicious
943,he's out duckshooting now
944,then she filled her vessel with water and left
945,naturally we have to do something about it
946,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
947,but nowhere could he find his new companion
948,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
949,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
950,her apartment is on the rd floor
951,who are you he heard a voice ask him in spanish
952,brenda peters just escaped from the county jail
953,she just stepped out
954,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
955,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
956,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
957,it's like the flight of those two hawks it can't be understood by reason alone
958,many of them had been right about what they said while some had been wrong
959,have a good trip
960,suddenly there is so much more time in a day because she no longer has to spend hours commuting
961,you've been doing mighty good work lately
962,are you trying to scoop us or something
963,i should say not
964,but he appeared to be unaware of any danger
965,you already know all you need to know
966,henderson was taking it in
967,something just flew by
968,the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
969,they was both too smart for us
970,my shampoo is made from coconut and sweet almond
971,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
972,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
973,most of my friends have already finished college
974,cables need insulation to prevent short circuits
975,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
976,somehow the paragraphs blurred into each other
977,what's so depressing about that
978,happy new year to you all
979,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
980,so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
981,i hate to think what he'll say
982,these figures of wax look creepy
983,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
984,he was able to get on his knees but he quickly slipped back
985,the method does not have to be the best
986,i'm surprised you didn't run into her
987,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
988,i know why i want to get back to my flock he thought
989,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
990,the space was spartan almost bare
991,at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
992,i told you homeboy smuggling is being prosecuted
993,something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
994,those are the rules of war the leader explained
995,the night was warm and i was thirsty
996,fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
997,the book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists
998,so many people on the subway are wearing black workout clothes
999,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
1000,the sun began its departure as well
1001,when the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it dazzled
1002,its lower end was still embedded
1003,the boss sent me over with it
1004,that's all you are
1005,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
1006,is it a deal
1007,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
1008,i heard a faint movement under my feet
1009,don't mind the colonel
1010,you've been doing mighty good work lately
1011,you got plenty of money
1012,the boy wanted to take her hand
1013,did she guarantee this place
1014,how can i ever face him
1015,he had surprised himself with the thought
1016,and don't forget to make him wear his raincoat in london
1017,the boy looked out at the horizon
1018,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
1019,just get me home
1020,but i was also stumbling because i couldnt look away from these things
1021,i noticed that the boy answered
1022,and don't forget the language of omens
1023,why'd you want to save me
1024,but we've never had any real trouble
1025,his heart squeezed as if his chest had suddenly compressed it
1026,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
1027,he was sure the girl would never understand
1028,what do you know about that
1029,every purchase is a vote
1030,i wonder what molly put in those tacos
1031,there's millions of ways
1032,and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
1033,the lens was heavy but it had an amazing zoom
1034,you said it to me too
1035,he wants me to write down only things that i think about but not things i plan to do
1036,and all's fair in love and war
1037,but no one actually saw her die
1038,the boy was becoming nervous
1039,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
1040,i saw him get it
1041,a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop
1042,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
1043,especially with an election coming up in a few days
1044,the fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard
1045,he was immensely excited at the news
1046,it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
1047,suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better
1048,he regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert
1049,because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game
1050,they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
1051,we'll save them for seed
1052,they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
1053,i'll be right here
1054,he turned on the microphone just as the hen was ready to squawk
1055,the boy began to dig into the dune
1056,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
1057,i say we don't go out any more
1058,ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend
1059,because its growth hormone runs away from sunlight
1060,lemon trees are not yellow it's just the fruit
1061,never mind those guys
1062,they called that discovery the master work  it was part liquid and part solid
1063,i wouldn't be a bit surprised
1064,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
1065,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
1066,in a little while
1067,a while ago i rode through the desert with a man who had books on alchemy
1068,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
1069,i guess you forgot something
1070,i can't let you have my plane
1071,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
1072,that makes sense the alchemist answered
1073,i'm not afraid to die
1074,he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
1075,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
1076,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
1077,i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
1078,you should show that your method improves results
1079,tickets for the broadcast are all gone
1080,i know why i want to get back to my flock he thought
1081,continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
1082,i am in search of that universal language among other things
1083,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
1084,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
1085,if it were he would already have heard of it
1086,i'm going into the desert the man answered turning back to his reading
1087,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
1088,everyone seemed very excited
1089,it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
1090,there was a full moon and the boy told the englishman the story of his life
1091,the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
1092,did she discuss it with you
1093,he couldn't have been wrong
1094,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
1095,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
1096,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
1097,the boy felt a pang in his heart thinking about the merchant's daughter
1098,the wind began to pick up
1099,no one attacks an oasis
1100,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
1101,where are they gone
1102,the references are good in the very narrow area of histogram methods
1103,i can't do that
1104,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
1105,it's as much my fault as yours
1106,as nice as blake's
1107,maktub thought the boy
1108,why would a king be talking with a shepherd the boy asked awed and embarrassed
1109,they both spoke the same language
1110,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
1111,it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
1112,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
1113,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
1114,you have developed a serious case of pneumonia
1115,i'm sure she'll be all right
1116,you can't take that desk out
1117,who told you that asked the boy startled
1118,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
1119,what are you talking about
1120,i didn't know whose it was
1121,not to worry said the alchemist
1122,brent's opening attack on the governor
1123,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
1124,enough said the boy
1125,it's just like any other day as far as i'm concerned
1126,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
1127,the burning fire had been extinguished
1128,she looks as though she's going to come to
1129,elizabeth charles is dead
1130,its been a long time since she last read chekhov and because of that she no longer feels like the heroine of her own story
1131,you don't deny that
1132,that he wanted to travel
1133,he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
1134,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
1135,then the thing came upon him in a flash
1136,the sun thought for a minute
1137,he condemned the commander to death without honor
1138,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
1139,what am i going to say to elvis
1140,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
1141,but they were not there
1142,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
1143,he understands the forces of nature
1144,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
1145,it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
1146,but horses tire bit by bit
1147,except for the dream
1148,the xylophone would just be a glockenspiel if it wasn't so metal
1149,please don't make me
1150,you jump i jump
1151,by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
1152,he didn't want any conversation at this point
1153,none of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy
1154,he's doing it because it's what he wants to do
1155,the boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker
1156,how do you mean
1157,of course the two were unable to do anything
1158,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
1159,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
1160,when i'm eating that's all i think about
1161,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
1162,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
1163,and he immediately felt peace in his heart
1164,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
1165,have a good time
1166,the one you marry has got to swim rivers for you
1167,well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
1168,we rejoiced at the citadel
1169,some went away while i was there and other people came
1170,the burning fire had been extinguished
1171,what's the matter with you
1172,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
1173,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
1174,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
1175,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
1176,i said good night
1177,people say strange things the boy thought
1178,i suppose i could
1179,two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
1180,the first day passed
1181,where was his horse
1182,meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
1183,aiding an escaped criminal
1184,if you can concentrate always on the present you'll be a happy man
1185,i saw him get it
1186,they ate in silence
1187,nice to meet you
1188,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
1189,he got up early with the idea of finding it
1190,there was no way to measure anything of that length
1191,is it all right
1192,can you see what is beyond the golden birches 
1193,they're starting to throw things
1194,we've done it said the englishman who had also awakened early
1195,taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
1196,those are the rules of war the leader explained
1197,it's a man who understands nature and the world
1198,that's all i ask
1199,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
1200,the sword didn't fall
1201,it was not clear who had the right of way since the traffic lights were off
1202,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
1203,she knows that men have to go away in order to return
1204,this is from the governor
1205,i'm going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said
1206,now you got me
1207,can i have one of those
1208,from then on the boy understood his heart
1209,the sun began its departure as well
1210,they can't help themselves
1211,everything has been written by the same hand
1212,i've got to get katie out of jail
1213,maybe she didn't even remember him
1214,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
1215,whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
1216,it seemed he had made the long journey for nothing
1217,and he wasn't faring much better
1218,show me where there is life out in the desert
1219,watch out for his venom the boy said
1220,she never told her that
1221,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
1222,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
1223,the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
1224,but i felt miserable watching him wither away like a shriveled dandelion
1225,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
1226,those are the rules of war the leader explained
1227,why didn't i call you back
1228,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
1229,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
1230,that's right said the old man able to read the boy's thoughts
1231,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
1232,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
1233,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
1234,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
1235,the drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels
1236,the two were taken to a nearby military camp
1237,he left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant
1238,but can we trust him
1239,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
1240,our new ai can dynamically adapt the balance of the gameplay
1241,that's never happened to me the boy said
1242,why should i be in any danger
1243,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
1244,four hundred and fifty dollars
1245,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
1246,plastic surgery has become more popular
1247,the crowd on the far left seemed to get bigger and i heard now a faint murmur from it
1248,he was immensely excited at the news
1249,chickens are adorable
1250,christmas is a lot like easter
1251,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
1252,i'm already used to the way things are
1253,are you a hypnotist
1254,that's what i'd like to know
1255,yours sincerely satan
1256,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
1257,of course i believe you
1258,the boy was shocked
1259,that tina thought it was funny
1260,and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
1261,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
1262,the wind began to blow again
1263,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
1264,when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
1265,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
1266,you have helped me the man continued to prepare his tea saying nothing
1267,i've got a weakness
1268,they both spoke the same language
1269,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
1270,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
1271,he didn't want any conversation at this point
1272,everyone seemed very excited
1273,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
1274,they called that discovery the master work  it was part liquid and part solid
1275,the arab accepted them without a word
1276,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
1277,as he was leaving he saw in the corner of the room his old shepherd's pouch
1278,that's what alchemists do
1279,the quicker the better
1280,he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
1281,he restarted his efforts for the twentieth time
1282,she gave them each a half to make them work together
1283,who gets your vote
1284,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
1285,it was sprayed in red with yellow edges
1286,all they think about is food and water
1287,we'll find you a hotel
1288,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
1289,the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
1290,there was very little talking
1291,it must be some kind of a gag
1292,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
1293,i know she writes them
1294,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
1295,it would kill you
1296,the sun thought about that and decided to shine more brightly
1297,you're in luck you two the fat arab said
1298,it was a bundle of money
1299,and he wasn't faring much better
1300,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
1301,he had never even wept in front of his own sheep
1302,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
1303,by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
1304,but don't worry the alchemist continued
1305,then taking his sheep he walked away
1306,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
1307,i shall make us some ice cubes
1308,it was early morning when she woke up
1309,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
1310,you'll get your money in sixty days
1311,he was planning as he left the bar
1312,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
1313,no he heard a voice on the wind say
1314,patrick has terminal cancer
1315,the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
1316,it looked like a rusty gas float
1317,what is the benefit of the method in terms of identification accuracy
1318,there's no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment
1319,i had never heard of alchemists before the boy said
1320,i myself heard nothing of that
1321,a boy came running towards me
1322,he drew on the back of his jacket with a blue fountain pen
1323,there were thirty girls on the soccer field
1324,that's got nothing to do with it
1325,everything you need to know you have learned through your journey
1326,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
1327,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
1328,i could eat a horse
1329,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
1330,we need to run
1331,i told you to practice
1332,on the first day he returned with a rabbit and on the second with two birds
1333,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
1334,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
1335,it was the pure language of the world
1336,another trick the boy thought
1337,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
1338,you will never be able to escape from your heart
1339,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
1340,he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
1341,you've got just ten minutes
1342,that song reminds me of my childhood
1343,the little group of people from the city dispersed
1344,two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
1345,he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
1346,when she saw the unknown object bobbing up and down the edge she was absolutely horrified
1347,it's the master work of the alchemists
1348,two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
1349,but he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk
1350,the boy brought his horse closer
1351,fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
1352,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
1353,but they were not there
1354,have you notified the police
1355,i know what you're feeling
1356,ten minutes for what
1357,whom are you calling now
1358,but the merchant understood what the boy had said
1359,his soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought
1360,who is this stranger who speaks of omens asked one of the chieftains eyeing the boy
1361,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
1362,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
1363,they rode for the entire day
1364,then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some
1365,i was sent down here to clean house
1366,he wanted your money he said
1367,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
1368,i think we were wrong about sally having the money
1369,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
1370,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
1371,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
1372,a boy came running towards me
1373,you lived your life in a loving way and died with dignity
1374,how much is it worth
1375,i'll just watch him he said to himself
1376,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine
1377,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
1378,and one or two persons were returning
1379,i thought that was peter parker
1380,but everything had changed
1381,an alchemist said the alchemist
1382,yeah its definitely worth checking out especially if the pay is reasonable and the work is good for your career there was absolutely no reason for her to announce it to the entire company
1383,i could see something in their faces
1384,no one said a word as the old man continued
1385,have you got that money
1386,a breeze began to blow
1387,the clock was slightly askew
1388,here's two thousand dollars
1389,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
1390,then the thing came upon him in a flash
1391,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
1392,she's written to me every day since
1393,it's called the principle of favorability
1394,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
1395,let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
1396,i've had this shop for thirty years
1397,there was a murmur from the crowd
1398,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
1399,the boy's heart began to speak of fear
1400,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
1401,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
1402,maybe that's why they always stay close to me
1403,who you holding out on
1404,don't worry i took a cab to get home safely
1405,my dog is an alsatian we call her 'poppy'
1406,from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
1407,you'll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants
1408,that sobered him a little
1409,i think its too overwhelming to introduce two complex tools that basically do the same things
1410,you've got the mayor and pullman backed against a wall
1411,the night was warm and i was thirsty
1412,and he gave the boy his blessing
1413,what's in that desk
1414,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
1415,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
1416,but the boy couldn't even speak
1417,it seemed he had made the long journey for nothing
1418,will you get out and let me handle this
1419,our deadline is coming up rapidly and we will need help
1420,but the tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert
1421,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
1422,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
1423,there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
1424,on the  o'clock train
1425,they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had
1426,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
1427,he got up early with the idea of finding it
1428,but he granted the travelers three days
1429,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
1430,whose turn is it
1431,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
1432,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
1433,and he wasn't faring much better
1434,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
1435,you'll find us everywhere
1436,it was the pure language of the world
1437,the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
1438,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
1439,don't ask me why i don't know why
1440,most meteorites are more or less rounded
1441,learn to recognize omens and follow them the old king had said
1442,everyone seemed very excited
1443,perhaps she met somebody
1444,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
1445,the shepherd swore that he would
1446,that life may always have flavor
1447,not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to
1448,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
1449,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
1450,we need to hurry
1451,it spoke of journeys discoveries books and change
1452,he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
1453,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
1454,it's going to take a while the boy said
1455,then the thing came upon him in a flash
1456,it sounded like a gypsy prayer
1457,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
1458,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
1459,first they tried to find him on their own
1460,he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
1461,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
1462,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
1463,of course the two were unable to do anything
1464,we should segregate the participants by age
1465,then we can climb mt helen
1466,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
1467,he wandered for a while keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight
1468,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
1469,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
1470,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
1471,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
1472,i told him we could teach her to ignore people who waste her time
1473,to realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation
1474,who are you he heard a voice ask him in spanish
1475,we've got to produce a show now
1476,yes or even search for treasure
1477,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
1478,and he hadn't perceived them because he had become accustomed to them
1479,then i don't get paid
1480,she accused an exconvict of stalking and sexual assault
1481,then i've only got an hour to dress
1482,the streamer of gas came out towards us
1483,if you have to wait until the war is over then wait
1484,he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
1485,the pilots braced themselves for impact
1486,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
1487,the men of the desert were already familiar with that wind
1488,i heard a faint movement under my feet
1489,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
1490,how do you like her
1491,a sight for sore eyes
1492,the merchant was silent for a few moments
1493,i'll give it a drink
1494,how long is what
1495,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
1496,the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
1497,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
1498,remember the interview i wrote with alice wellman
1499,how do you mean
1500,it seemed so safe and tranquil
1501,i'll be right back
1502,for your first installation i highly recommend using their prepackaged version of python to avoid trouble
1503,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
1504,take that fire extinguisher and put out the fire
1505,others stumbled upon the stone by accident
1506,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
1507,and he gave the boy his blessing
1508,stick to your clubs
1509,my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
1510,last time i made the mistake of replicating a drawing by rodin
1511,taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
1512,he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
1513,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
1514,the shirt off my back
1515,the desert with its endless monotony put him to dreaming
1516,it's a beautiful miracle
1517,she looks kind of bored
1518,she's a feisty little ferret
1519,it's the name of the prophet's daughter fatima said
1520,the terrorist group made their demand
1521,but they were not there
1522,and so do i
1523,i was impatient to see it opened
1524,he expertly gutted the rabbit
1525,as they began to decorate the hallway a silhouette appeared in the doorway
1526,when did you arrive in town
1527,an important difference is the amount of experiences that is to say inputs
1528,because you are trying to realize your destiny
1529,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
1530,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
1531,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
1532,so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
1533,would you like a cappuccino
1534,do you think steven would have let you keep it
1535,but a lovely chap
1536,then the thing came upon him in a flash
1537,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
1538,the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange
1539,tomorrow at this same time bring me a tenth of your flock
1540,i can see that
1541,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
1542,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
1543,class was dismissed due to a freak incident caused by a chemical spill
1544,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind
1545,my review of the sun one star
1546,it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
1547,but she is gone
1548,i don't believe it
1549,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
1550,you can't believe it's not butter
1551,suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better
1552,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
1553,its lower end was still embedded
1554,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
1555,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
1556,i guess i used all the shells
1557,they can't do that to me
1558,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
1559,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
1560,he disappeared into the tent
1561,how would you like to work for me
1562,this was my destiny not yours the alchemist answered
1563,later we simply let life proceed in its own direction toward its own fate
1564,a pile of soft ashes coated her body and filled her nostrils
1565,then came the night of the first falling star
1566,of course the two were unable to do anything
1567,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
1568,people said that gypsies spent their lives tricking others
1569,he wanted to tell him about fatima
1570,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
1571,as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
1572,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
1573,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
1574,maktub thought the boy
1575,i'm terribly sorry she isn't here
1576,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
1577,i'm observing passiveaggressive behavior the psychologist said in a professional tone
1578,the camel driver understood what the boy was saying
1579,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
1580,that's the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
1581,how do people celebrate good weather over there
1582,i just got rid of one crowd
1583,and i will tell you how to find the hidden treasure
1584,they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had
1585,thanks for the clarification
1586,fatima was more important than his treasure
1587,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
1588,when the simum ceased to blow everyone looked to the place where the boy had been
1589,the boy looked out at the horizon
1590,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
1591,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
1592,they raised their glasses in the old bar
1593,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
1594,he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
1595,the report was largely scathing
1596,and then he perceived it very slowly
1597,that's the best part of it
1598,i tore him apart
1599,some of our biggest clients are affected
1600,i'm going to them
1601,the englishman was disappointed
1602,we got orders to hold you safely in the branches of this pine tree
1603,we miss you and miss having a friend like you and i am so happy that you two got to catch up
1604,so the wind blew with all its strength and the sky was filled with sand
1605,listen to that mob
1606,can i help you
1607,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
1608,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
1609,well he thought about that the old man said
1610,but the crystal merchant had no choice
1611,they ate in silence
1612,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
1613,he asked it please never to stop speaking to him
1614,the wind began to pick up
1615,they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
1616,i have to separate out the sulfur
1617,and he wasn't faring much better
1618,did you learn anything the englishman asked eager to hear what it might be
1619,the sweet corn tasted better grilled
1620,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
1621,instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boy's forehead
1622,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
1623,and he gave the boy his blessing
1624,before he gets through tonight he'll ruin us all
1625,should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
1626,wait till those two future jailbirds read the morning post tomorrow
1627,then the two went off to have some more tea
1628,she needs to get her transcripts and passport first
1629,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
1630,the serpent relaxed immediately
1631,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
1632,he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
1633,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
1634,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
1635,a while ago i rode through the desert with a man who had books on alchemy
1636,he slipped on the stairs
1637,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
1638,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
1639,it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
1640,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
1641,the alchemist dismounted slowly and the boy did the same
1642,i was torn between fear and curiosity
1643,his soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought
1644,what do you know about miranda
1645,the boy went to the well every day to meet with fatima
1646,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
1647,keep your shirt on
1648,where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
1649,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
1650,then who are you
1651,he appeared with the first stars of evening
1652,i haven't any hard feelings
1653,they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
1654,have trusted more in your love for fatima
1655,when were these books written the boy asked
1656,they're always after me for interviews
1657,not that i was listening but i noticed that you sounded really stressed when you were explaining the situation to him
1658,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
1659,but when the reign of tiberius ended his poems were forgotten
1660,because life wants you to achieve your destiny
1661,want to walk to new york
1662,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
1663,i left my father my mother and the town castle behind
1664,what do you know about that
1665,did you bring the christmas wreath
1666,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
1667,the soul of the world is nourished by people's happiness
1668,i myself heard nothing of that
1669,give me precise instructions how to decontaminate the trooper
1670,the alien gurgled and thrashed its tentacles
1671,who engineered this getaway
1672,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
1673,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
1674,we've got to do something
1675,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
1676,they filled three sacks
1677,the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
1678,next morning there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at al fayoum
1679,and he asked the boy if he too were in search of the alchemist
1680,only in that way would he be able to read the omens
1681,one that will write
1682,from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
1683,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
1684,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
1685,every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world
1686,he tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones
1687,he really was a king
1688,our generator has been disrupted by ultra high frequency waves
1689,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
1690,the hookahs were extinguished and the guards stood at attention
1691,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
1692,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
1693,that was the law of hospitality
1694,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
1695,but she said nothing
1696,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
1697,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
1698,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
1699,they'll take care of it
1700,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
1701,and he told what he had seen
1702,he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
1703,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
1704,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
1705,the ceiling collapsed inwards
1706,who told you about omens the boy's interest was increasing by the moment
1707,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
1708,there is a whole lot of joy in playing piano
1709,i'll return just as your father came back to your mother he said
1710,better to get half than nothing
1711,alfayoum is in egypt said the arab
1712,wearing his new sandals he descended the stairs silently
1713,there was a general movement backwards
1714,maybe we'd better call herman
1715,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
1716,the old man said nothing
1717,it's even higher than this
1718,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
1719,i'm afraid it is important
1720,nobody's trying to steal from you
1721,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
1722,the old man looked disappointed
1723,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
1724,i myself heard nothing of that
1725,the boy began to dig into the dune
1726,neighbors moved away and there remained only a few small shops on the hill
1727,the same book that taught me about urim and thummim
1728,eventually the merchant had to hire two more employees
1729,to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
1730,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
1731,but he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk
1732,dont share your opinions so readily because you never know who is listening
1733,so you got married
1734,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
1735,you have no idea what's happened to me
1736,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
1737,to show you one of life's simple lessons the alchemist answered
1738,i'm going with you the boy said
1739,its too early to tell whether the strategy will pay off
1740,just by looking at them
1741,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
1742,he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
1743,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
1744,and one or two persons were returning
1745,he could always become a crystal salesman again
1746,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
1747,the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
1748,the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone
1749,there was hardly any movement from the pit
1750,it's the only name i've got
1751,the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
1752,and at that i told him and he took my place
1753,his father said no more
1754,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
1755,the other son was a poet and delighted all of rome with his beautiful verses
1756,then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
1757,the police finally manage to get him out of the park
1758,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
1759,what do you know about it
1760,he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
1761,from then on he would make his own decisions
1762,i'm going to put her through college
1763,but in his heart he knew that it did matter
1764,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
1765,the men were terrified at his sorcery
1766,life attracts life the alchemist answered
1767,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
1768,then came the night of the first falling star
1769,there was an accident at work a camel stampede nearly killed the janitor
1770,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
1771,not even a stick of gum
1772,i know good crystal from bad and everything else there is to know about crystal
1773,if you want something you gotta go get it
1774,if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
1775,most meteorites are more or less rounded
1776,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
1777,i learned how to care for sheep and i haven't forgotten how that's done
1778,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
1779,the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
1780,but a lovely chap
1781,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
1782,at once he connected the two incidents
1783,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
1784,so you got married
1785,i want my baby to look like you
1786,they become a part of everything
1787,alchemy is a serious discipline
1788,he doesn't have anything else
1789,they were strange books
1790,what do you think
1791,and i will tell you how to find the hidden treasure
1792,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
1793,i told you that your dream was a difficult one
1794,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
1795,have a good look
1796,you got your sea legs yet
1797,but they could never have taught him arabic
1798,i want to stay at the oasis the boy answered
1799,but she hadn't charged him anything
1800,please never throw salami pizza away
1801,one of the worst crooks in town
1802,the hunter was alerted by the sound of rustling vegetation behind her
1803,he left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant
1804,i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled
1805,the music was captivating
1806,they never found the secret
1807,i don't want anything else in life
1808,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
1809,except for the dream
1810,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
1811,it was a bundle of money
1812,i wouldn't take that too seriously
1813,as they watched the waves crashing into each other alice thought of home
1814,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
1815,what happened to your wings
1816,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
1817,he had never even wept in front of his own sheep
1818,did you get him
1819,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
1820,i think we were wrong about sally having the money
1821,don't be an idiot
1822,he quickly pulled his hands away
1823,then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
1824,the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
1825,she never trusted me
1826,his father said no more
1827,i can learn something from the desert too
1828,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
1829,i'm getting out of here and you can't stop me
1830,give me my book the boy said
1831,i never saw it before
1832,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
1833,this will help you effectively collaborate with developers and coordinate crossteam projects throughout your career
1834,i'm the king of salem the old man had said
1835,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
1836,i could have helped her
1837,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
1838,you can't believe it's not butter
1839,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
1840,how much do you make a week
1841,if good things are coming they will be a pleasant surprise said the seer
1842,one by one the campfires were extinguished and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert
1843,i've already told you
1844,none of this ha d made an impression on the boy
1845,try it again
1846,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
1847,on the third day the chief met with his officers
1848,i do the best i can to help
1849,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
1850,the boy told him then that he needed to get to the pyramids
1851,start pounding that typewriter
1852,she's a feisty little ferret

1872,you'll ask me to what
1873,they're not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia

1877,from then on he would make his own decisions

1887,the boy was relieved
1888,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
1889,what do you think you're doing holding up traffic

2037,who are you he heard a voice ask him in spanish
2038,the boy spent a sleepless night
2039,i just saw the sheriff
2040,and a glass of milk
2041,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
2042,they were on the right track
2043,that gives you an idea of what i'm up against
2044,they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
2045,when you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win
2046,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
2047,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
2048,you're going to run into the governor
2049,i don't know how to explain it
2050,plastic surgery has become more popular
2051,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
2052,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
2053,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
2054,however the authors ignore a very large body of work on tone mapping

2060,want to walk to new york
2061,i've had this shop for thirty years

2063,so his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon
2064,what he said reminded the boy of the old king
2065,is that screwball pitpat still around
2066,the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
2067,the atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke
2068,the city sealer's office
2069,even when all you want to do is travel
2070,turning off gadgets that are not in use can save a lot of energy
2071,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
2072,well why don't you go to mecca now asked the boy
2073,you wanna take this outside
2074,did you get the mayor
2075,and at that i told him and he took my place
2076,you wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town
2077,but can we trust him
2078,i'll show those guys
2079,he wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth and put them back in his bag
2080,he knelt down to find urim and thummim and put them back in the pouch
2081,let's go hiking across france
2082,he still calls his mother 'mummy'

2087,let's stop this another commander said
2088,i'm not taking any more chances
2089,it brought his heart into his mouth
2090,you don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you
2091,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
2092,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
2093,he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
2094,the lead had dried into the shape of the pan but it was no longer lead
2095,the boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day
2096,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
2097,you should show that your method improves results
2098,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
2099,i've never had one before the merchant answered
2100,still can't contact conway
2101,yet it was a little too large for assurance
2102,i didn't want the publicity
2103,i didn't even ask him
2104,the boy was astonished by what he saw inside
2105,he was sure the girl would never understand
2106,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
2107,it's a good thing i got here in time
2108,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
2109,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
2110,she couldn't find a waste basket
2111,suddenly for no apparent reason the boy's horse began to slow
2112,they were always just somebody to fill up the bleachers
2113,i shall make us some ice cubes
2114,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
2115,and finally the falcon returned with their meal
2116,this recording is corrupted
2117,he was more certain of it than of anything in the world
2118,so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
2119,yet it was a little too large for assurance
2120,the idea frightened him
2121,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
2122,the englishman had several suitcases filled with books
2123,you're just the one i wanted to see
2124,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
2125,that's why burns is here
2126,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
2127,it means my job
2128,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
2129,what do you mean by that
2130,the girls didnt know who to trust so they ran fast
2131,i'm going with you the boy said
2132,please don't appeal to my sentimental side
2133,he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
2134,anthony kept himself busy by counting pigeons
2135,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
2136,get out of here
2137,the only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion
2138,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
2139,the internet of uncontrolled things brought us a distributed denial of service attack once again
2140,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
2141,the boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was clear to him
2142,and shouldn't they be garnished
2143,this is the mayor
2144,crossing your own pals
2145,by letting me help you
2146,they'll never close us up today
2147,the meeting was over
2148,i had it served with my breakfast this morning
2149,first he had studied esperanto then the world's religions and now it was alchemy
2150,i could have helped her
2151,after two hours he returned to the room where the wise man was
2152,the boy didn't say anything
2153,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
2154,because you are trying to realize your destiny
2155,on the third day the chief met with his officers
2156,something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
2157,drunken elks are very dangerous be aware
2158,i need some time to think
2159,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
2160,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
2161,our mortgage is in arrears
2162,the sword didn't fall
2163,the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
2164,the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
2165,give me my book the boy said
2166,mars is almost uninhabitable
2167,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
2168,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
2169,there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy
2170,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
2171,nature knows me as the wisest being in creation the sun said
2172,one of us is going to jail
2173,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
2174,it's a commentary on what we laughingly call the civilized world
2175,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
2176,and i'd better read your books said the boy
2177,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
2178,i dont mind working from home most of the time but i do miss having coworkers
2179,a practice of infidels he said to himself
2180,i have known true alchemists the alchemist continued
2181,i want those stamps
2182,there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy
2183,the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
2184,next morning there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at al fayoum
2185,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
2186,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
2187,there is a way out
2188,the sun began its departure as well
2189,the tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty pieces of gold
2190,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
2191,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
2192,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
2193,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
2194,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
2195,i have to find a man who knows that universal language
2196,the boy thought of fatima
2197,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
2198,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
2199,someone set fire to the trash
2200,they'd never let you go
2201,in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
2202,the caravan moved toward the east
2203,what a wonderful weather
2204,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
2205,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
2206,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
2207,how about that one there
2208,wait till those two future jailbirds read the morning post tomorrow
2209,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
2210,breakfast is usually earlier than this she thought
2211,know what my old man did when i joined up
2212,i got two giant bug bites on my right leg from last night and they hurt
2213,wait a minute
2214,he wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man
2215,the two walked out among the palms
2216,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
2217,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
2218,mozzarella is a creamy cheese that goes well with tomato and basil
2219,he's the man the ads are written for
2220,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
2221,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
2222,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
2223,the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
2224,am i talking too much
2225,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
2226,the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
2227,i don't blame them
2228,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
2229,at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
2230,apologies for not calling you back
2231,it took him a while to get to the office
2232,the swat entry team used an optical wand to observe the proceedings behind the door
2233,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
2234,i just know that the tradition is always right
2235,that baker he said to himself without completing the thought
2236,but the king of salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful
2237,he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
2238,i learned the alchemist's secrets in my travels
2239,the stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy's forehead
2240,it seemed so safe and tranquil
2241,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
2242,if i could i'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence
2243,when i'm eating that's all i think about
2244,he also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep
2245,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
2246,for every ten dead men among our enemies you will receive a piece of gold
2247,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
2248,many telescopes were pointed at it
2249,i want to live again
2250,the serpent relaxed immediately
2251,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
2252,what do i do in salem the old man laughed
2253,it's the oasis said the camel driver
2254,this wedge prevents the trailer from rolling down the slope in case of brake failure
2255,who is this stranger who speaks of omens asked one of the chieftains eyeing the boy
2256,better get a pencil out and write it down
2257,the horse galloped uncontrollably
2258,isn't it just beautiful
2259,you knew the whole story
2260,the camel driver though seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war
2261,we must get some of that serum as soon as possible
2262,no more tickets left
2263,i'll be a monkey's uncle
2264,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
2265,unfortunately nobody can warrant the sanctions that will have an effect on the community
2266,never mind the european war
2267,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
2268,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
2269,but he had to move on
2270,the sun thought about that and decided to shine more brightly
2271,mind if i sit down
2272,that's true the boy thought
2273,this man looked exactly the same except that now the roles were reversed
2274,but that was simply because my eye was tired
2275,artisanal gin bar seriously
2276,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
2277,you mustn't let what she said bother you
2278,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
2279,we miss you and miss having a friend like you and i am so happy that you two got to catch up
2280,once again he was experiencing the language without words
2281,to realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation
2282,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
2283,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
2284,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
2285,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
2286,the omens had been true after all
2287,you weren't here to build them
2288,it was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden
2289,you should read the new book mark twain's writing now
2290,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
2291,he had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace
2292,the one you're blocking
2293,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
2294,i feel like a bootlegger
2295,there's no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment
2296,your mother and i talked it over half the night
2297,image registration and invariant representations could both be done in a computationally very efficient way
2298,but she said nothing
2299,from there he could see africa in the distance
2300,he can't hurt anybody
2301,the boy accustomed to recognizing omens spoke to the merchant
2302,you'll be the counselor of the oasis
2303,yet it was a little too large for assurance
2304,they set off running wildly into the trees
2305,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
2306,the englishman said nothing
2307,the falcon's beak carries bits of me myself the desert said
2308,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
2309,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
2310,i promised that i would make my own decisions he said to himself
2311,everyone seemed very excited
2312,i find the other argument dubious
2313,peertopeer networks are more robust than clientserver architectures
2314,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
2315,come in again some time
2316,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
2317,the night was warm and i was thirsty
2318,an army is coming the boy said
2319,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
2320,then she again took his hands and studied them carefully
2321,i imagine this will be a surprise to some people
2322,suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better
2323,but bakers are more important people than shepherds
2324,don't sit there like a frozen robin
2325,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
2326,joshua regretted buying a cheap air conditioner now that it was warmer
2327,the next day he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient spanish gold coins
2328,i have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes
2329,there was very little talking
2330,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
2331,but he knew that salem wasn't in andalusia
2332,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
2333,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
2334,and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
2335,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
2336,to nourish the falcon
2337,the boy was shocked
2338,they mounted their horses
2339,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
2340,in a way so am i he said
2341,she told me she feels hopeful and optimistic
2342,the woman was silent for some time
2343,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
2344,leanne joined a choir so everyone could hear her sublime singing voice
2345,i don't want to rush you
2346,if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
2347,worryingly the radio signal became weaker
2348,happy to know you
2349,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
2350,the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
2351,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
2352,i'm going to take over a lot of plates and things
2353,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
2354,the burning fire had been extinguished
2355,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
2356,i'm interested only in the present
2357,goodbye said the boy
2358,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
2359,the men were terrified at his sorcery
2360,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
2361,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
2362,the boy awoke as the sun rose
2363,because the crystal was dirty
2364,and they had understood each other perfectly well
2365,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
2366,he forgets the office when he's with me
2367,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
2368,'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
2369,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
2370,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
2371,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
2372,i can learn something from the desert too
2373,the monk was irritated
2374,i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance
2375,i had to test your courage the stranger said
2376,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
2377,he began to dig at the base of the sycamore
2378,of course the two were unable to do anything
2379,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
2380,there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
2381,maybe she didn't even remember him
2382,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
2383,then like a colony of worker ants they dismantled their stalls and left
2384,even then he hardly understood what this meant
2385,the camel driver understood what the boy was saying
2386,he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
2387,and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
2388,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
2389,there ain't any more
2390,he deleted five tables from the database
2391,the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
2392,i was right there and saw it with my own eyes
2393,you're demanding your rights
2394,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
2395,a great humanitarian and the best friend the jessie bakers have
2396,but then they wouldn't be a part of your future the seer had said
2397,the boy trusted his new friend
2398,did you actually give tamara that gun
2399,your heart is alive
2400,then came the night of the first falling star
2401,show me some gratitude
2402,but the boy sat down and waited
2403,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
2404,then the old man began to inspect the sheep and he saw that one was lame
2405,the secret is here in the present
2406,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
2407,and what do you do in salem he insisted
2408,but he didn't need to worry about that right now
2409,he got up early with the idea of finding it
2410,let's the alchemist answered
2411,you're the one who may die the alchemist said
2412,it was as if carl realised that he was a puppet under someone else's control
2413,it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself
2414,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
2415,which one are you
2416,there was enough there to buy a lot of weapons
2417,know what my old man did when i joined up
2418,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
2419,the old man returned the book to the boy
2420,and then he perceived it very slowly
2421,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
2422,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
2423,i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running away
2424,the boy didn't know what a person's destiny was
2425,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
2426,no one paid any attention to the two travelers
2427,the young arab took out a book and began to read
2428,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
2429,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
2430,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
2431,when he emerged it was with a young arab dressed in white and gold
2432,we'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything
2433,something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
2434,he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
2435,most meteorites are more or less rounded
2436,without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
2437,michael opened a browser and navigated to an anonymous search engine
2438,because i don't live in either my past or my future
2439,it's late in the evening a perfect time for coffee
2440,the alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals
2441,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
2442,he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
2443,he was thinking about omens and someone had appeared
2444,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
2445,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
2446,the plastic barrier shattered
2447,say something else
2448,they are not really friends they just work together and talk from time to time
2449,i guess i was homesick
2450,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
2451,an army is coming the boy said
2452,the sun began its departure as well
2453,tell them to start getting those extras out
2454,the sword didn't fall
2455,what do i do in salem the old man laughed
2456,all they think about is food and water
2457,the elevators are still running
2458,turn on the lights
2459,and i'm going to build things
2460,help me the boy said
2461,caught it coming home from school
2462,it's a private club for only the most respectable people
2463,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
2464,the boy was shocked
2465,it was just right
2466,give me my book the boy said
2467,some storms are worth the wreckage
2468,i'm not talking about his grandfather's pet poodle
2469,we speak of them only to children
2470,that's what i'm going to do
2471,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
2472,i don't want to take any chances
2473,you get out of here quick
2474,they'd never let you go
2475,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
2476,she placed the glass carefully on the edge of the table
2477,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
2478,you have been a real blessing to me
2479,i came over with johnny
2480,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
2481,i don't know if i'll be able to find life in the desert the boy thought
2482,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
2483,this farm had cattle chicken sheep and many other animals
2484,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
2485,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
2486,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
2487,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
2488,some storms are worth the wreckage
2489,just for the first year
2490,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
2491,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
2492,and don't bump into anything
2493,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
2494,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
2495,the old woman had said the same thing
2496,i said i wish i'd never been born
2497,i gave you fifty just the other day
2498,where is the treasure he asked
2499,he preferred to sit down and wait
2500,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
2501,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
2502,happy new year to you all
2503,and the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have
2504,this is jon davis
2505,the boy awoke as the sun rose
2506,three cheers for aden christopher
2507,but none of that mattered to the alchemist
2508,tomorrow is another day
2509,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
2510,once again he was experiencing the language without words
2511,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
2512,every search begins with beginner's luck
2513,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
2514,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
2515,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
2516,how do i guess at the future
2517,yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster
2518,listen to your heart
2519,we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
2520,the boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident
2521,christmas eve at midnight
2522,first you got to sign a receipt
2523,it made me very depressed
2524,the octopus worried the squid
2525,the boy tried to read what was written in the sand
2526,the war is going to end someday the girl said
2527,i told you that your dream was a difficult one
2528,they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
2529,you wanna take this outside
2530,we must be good
2531,think i'd better be going
2532,have trusted more in your love for fatima
2533,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
2534,he decided to return to his friend's stable by the longest route possible
2535,he could always become a crystal salesman again
2536,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
2537,you'll marry fatima and you'll both be happy for a year
2538,i guess i'm not quite the football type
2539,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
2540,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
2541,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
2542,the octopus worried the squid
2543,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
2544,and he gave the boy his blessing
2545,she finds the world has feet of clay
2546,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
2547,a part of me is also trying to come to terms with the fact that i won't be able to travel as much anymore
2548,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
2549,carbon monoxide is a very dangerous gas
2550,i never said i'd take it
2551,his tshirt was drenched in sweat
2552,only chris couldn't wait quite as long as the others
2553,how does anything like this ever start
2554,when you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win
2555,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
2556,the woman was silent for some time
2557,he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
2558,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
2559,two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
2560,he brought six sheep with him
2561,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
2562,it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
2563,we want some action in these pictures
2564,you knew the whole story
2565,if you can concentrate always on the present you'll be a happy man
2566,he'll be ready on time
2567,how they managed to improvise at such short notice she'll never know
2568,one afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes
2569,there's nobody else on the paper who can write
2570,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
2571,everything has been written by the same hand
2572,you're right when you say my father was no business man
2573,the boy spent a sleepless night
2574,the money is unimportant
2575,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
2576,one is loved because one is loved
2577,there was very little talking
2578,not only did he manage to do it he did it professionally
2579,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
2580,half an hour later his shovel hit something solid
2581,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
2582,as they watched the waves crashing into each other alice thought of home
2583,now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
2584,none of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy
2585,two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
2586,you wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town
2587,well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
2588,can i help you asked the man behind the window
2589,i'm going into business for myself
2590,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
2591,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
2592,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
2593,we're having hamburgers
2594,it was sprayed in red with yellow edges
2595,the authors claim to specifically address variations due to geometric transformations in the acquired images
2596,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
2597,henderson was taking it in
2598,he didn't want to cry with the other people there
2599,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
2600,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
2601,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
2602,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
2603,just one thing more
2604,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
2605,but one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole
2606,they'd never let you go
2607,you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
2608,you've played it over and over again
2609,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
2610,the boy went to the well every day to meet with fatima
2611,well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
2612,of course you wouldn't know
2613,the boy repeated his question
2614,he rose and made his way back toward the palm trees
2615,tell her i elected her and i can have her impeached
2616,or a man into the wind
2617,it's called the principle of favorability
2618,the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
2619,everything has been written by the same hand
2620,stop treating me like a child
2621,every time he saw her he felt nervous
2622,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
2623,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
2624,you know what we're going to do
2625,it really ought to be easy except that right now there's an outstanding bug
2626,teaching kids english with common voice is a winwin situation
2627,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
2628,i have known true alchemists the alchemist continued
2629,the term just my two cents is about opinion not about money
2630,can i get a woot woot
2631,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
2632,close shot of the colonel
2633,he didn't want to cry with the other people there
2634,he could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life
2635,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
2636,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
2637,i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
2638,maybe that's why they came
2639,the boy thought about the crystal merchant
2640,i don't want anything else in life
2641,dee's house right now
2642,earlier this year we found a really nice place near my office and we moved in together
2643,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
2644,is there no sense of honor left in this country
2645,sometimes there's just no way to hold back the river
2646,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
2647,he was alarmed by what had happened
2648,but we've all got to get in there and play
2649,there might be secret messages in this text
2650,i find that the best way to combat this issue is to use the builtin vocabulary editor
2651,he watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind
2652,some of our biggest clients are affected
2653,then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some
2654,i'm leaving today said the boy
2655,say something else
2656,because the crystal was dirty
2657,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
2658,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
2659,i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought
2660,the women took turns building a tall stable pile of rocks
2661,then whose is it
2662,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
2663,but i never said anything like that
2664,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
2665,because you have already lost your savings twice
2666,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
2667,came to the bar he had entered on his first day there
2668,and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
2669,everyone seemed very excited
2670,you have no car
2671,we couldn't make it in a week
2672,the five french tourists stepped over the excited bulldogs
2673,you're the only one left
2674,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
2675,the streamer of gas came out towards us
2676,did you hear what i said
2677,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
2678,the streamer of gas came out towards us
2679,there are many languages spoken by things the boy said
2680,there was a general movement backwards
2681,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
2682,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
2683,they eat lunch together often but dont really talk outside the office
2684,i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
2685,but i'm not through complaining yet
2686,it is still a phenomenal movement
2687,it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
2688,i don't want anything else in life
2689,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
2690,i told him that was what i had come here to learn
2691,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
2692,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
2693,the burning fire had been extinguished
2694,i have to separate out the sulfur
2695,he had studied latin spanish and theology
2696,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
2697,he felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the pyramids had been built
2698,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
2699,but the merchant understood what the boy had said
2700,i suppose that's true in a way
2701,it's past your bedtime
2702,yeah better if people are already familiar with one and are thinking of switching to the other
2703,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
2704,what'll i tell him
2705,i'm an old superstitious arab and i believe in our proverbs
2706,he was thinking about omens and someone had appeared
2707,several figures approached him
2708,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
2709,i guess i was homesick
2710,then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
2711,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
2712,what day is it
2713,an alchemist said the alchemist
2714,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
2715,the boy was getting irritated
2716,i ain't gonna squeal
2717,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
2718,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
2719,i am proud of you he said
2720,what are you doing up here then
2721,the englishman didn't answer him directly
2722,yeah i like that
2723,they set off running wildly into the trees
2724,the wind began to blow again
2725,they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
2726,the insurgents gathered sticks and wood
2727,suddenly for no apparent reason the boy's horse began to slow
2728,one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
2729,his father said no more
2730,first they tried to find him on their own
2731,our mortgage is in arrears
2732,his internet connection was too slow
2733,the boy was sad as he left her that day
2734,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
2735,traveling alone is good for meeting new people
2736,and better still to be alone with one's books
2737,henderson was taking it in
2738,he brought six sheep with him
2739,because the crystal was dirty
2740,because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game
2741,this banana tastes like cherries
2742,how long is it
2743,the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
2744,and the solid part was called the philosopher's stone
2745,the stranger withdrew the sword from the boy's forehead and the boy felt immensely relieved
2746,the omens had been true after all
2747,give me my robe
2748,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
2749,do you mind if i sit down
2750,alchemy is a serious discipline
2751,what have you done with them
2752,you certainly delivered the goods
2753,how do you expect me to get any work done
2754,most meteorites are more or less rounded
2755,and find out where the nearest telegraph office is
2756,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
2757,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
2758,they're not concerned with that right now
2759,they reminded him of the old man
2760,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
2761,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
2762,that's about the best description i know
2763,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
2764,mayonnaise is made from eggs oil vinegar and mustard
2765,carol saved her brother's life that day
2766,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
2767,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
2768,did you ever walk into this office
2769,you hit my best friend
2770,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
2771,the boy went to the well every day to meet with fatima
2772,we can't leave greg here
2773,i can help him
2774,have you got the speech i gave you
2775,she's just about to close up the library
2776,on the third day the chief met with his officers
2777,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
2778,diy projects can help you save money and tailor things to your needs
2779,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
2780,this is for you
2781,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
2782,to keep on pitching
2783,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
2784,it's a nasty day
2785,the shepherd swore that he would
2786,he is going to transform himself into the wind just to demonstrate his powers
2787,you can't offer me something that is already mine the chief said arrogantly
2788,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
2789,he got up early with the idea of finding it
2790,the desert fills men's hearts with visions the camel driver answered
2791,i was impatient to see it opened
2792,i never saw amanda act like that before
2793,it's called the principle of favorability
2794,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
2795,he got up early with the idea of finding it
2796,the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
2797,that's why i'm here
2798,there's a bunch of autograph seekers out front
2799,never mind those guys
2800,the boy thought of fatima
2801,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
2802,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
2803,once to the thief and once to the general
2804,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
2805,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
2806,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
2807,there was no excuse for goodman to fly off the handle
2808,i'm interested only in the present
2809,at night they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden
2810,the omens had told him so
2811,the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
2812,the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
2813,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
2814,he just got a new kite for his birthday
2815,it's not my house
2816,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
2817,are you in the book
2818,it almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted
2819,it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
2820,everybody quiet and ready for an emergency
2821,throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies
2822,can i go now
2823,what is it you're looking for asked the old merchant
2824,he knew all the fields and pastures of andalusia
2825,he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
2826,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
2827,it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
2828,it drew a droplet of blood
2829,it's not what enters men's mouths that's evil said the alchemist
2830,it's called the principle of favorability beginner's luck
2831,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
2832,the boy thought it a strange question
2833,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
2834,you got your watermelon
2835,mister kristen has something to say to us
2836,i lost my wallet
2837,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
2838,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
2839,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
2840,he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
2841,and also by unhappiness envy and jealousy
2842,they walked together through the narrow streets of tangier
2843,there was a general movement backwards
2844,when i tried it about a year ago it didn't work nearly as well as using it on my local machine
2845,the emerald tablet is a direct passage to the soul of the world
2846,he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
2847,he carried two dead hawks over his shoulder
2848,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
2849,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
2850,whenever he saw the sea or a fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force
2851,there was surely a baker in her town
2852,she had her cardigan on
2853,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
2854,send those other people in
2855,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
2856,the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
2857,what have you got to report
2858,she may be lost
2859,any time but christmas
2860,better bring me a glass of milk
2861,why couldn't you just look at his feet
2862,the levanter increased in intensity
2863,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
2864,you came so that you could learn about your dreams said the old woman
2865,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
2866,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
2867,the old man was probably a gypsy too
2868,that isn't what i got married for
2869,and he immediately felt peace in his heart
2870,we want you to know that we're all for you
2871,she can't get away
2872,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
2873,he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
2874,the millennium edition of the album contains multiple remixes and the lyrics
2875,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
2876,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
2877,my review of the sun one star
2878,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
2879,and a labor leader like melville
2880,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
2881,collateral of any kind
2882,look where you're going
2883,the paper presents a variant of a hidden markov model for images
2884,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
2885,today i understand something i didn't see before every blessing ignored becomes a curse
2886,they become a part of everything
2887,the tricky part is integrating it with dragonfly
2888,the boy was shocked
2889,she comes by it naturally
2890,you haven't told me
2891,the levanter increased in intensity
2892,what is it that i still need to know the boy asked
2893,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
2894,i have had the same dream twice he said
2895,i'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this
2896,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
2897,i need some coffee
2898,and at that i told him and he took my place
2899,it's not so bad
2900,but everything had changed
2901,he had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace
2902,that's rather big talk
2903,i gotta figure some way out of this thing
2904,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
2905,i wished i had a light to smoke by
2906,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
2907,they were men of the desert and they were fearful of sorcerers
2908,what is it that i still need to know the boy asked
2909,does the name brian anderson mean anything to you
2910,this is keith miller
2911,she bought cucumbers at the marketplace
2912,and then the boy understood
2913,this is what was written on the emerald tablet said the alchemist when he had finished
2914,now i too will be one of the women who wait
2915,you've got a nerve accusing people of things
2916,it looked like a rusty gas float
2917,give me the district attorney's office
2918,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
2919,you can't kid me
2920,he just got a new kite for his birthday
2921,show me the movie schedule for whore ii
2922,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
2923,ill join you in a minute after i lock my bike
2924,even the guides spoke very little to one another
2925,what's the fifth obligation the boy asked
2926,he wasn't asking for help
2927,from there he could see africa in the distance
2928,all they wanted was food and water
2929,it was there that the wise man lived
2930,the two were taken to a nearby military camp
2931,then he turned to the boy this time his expression was cold and distant
2932,i swear it on my mother's grave
2933,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
2934,the insurgents gathered sticks and wood
2935,you've got about two minutes
2936,then why do you suppose he hasn't at least called up
2937,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
2938,in any case it's good that you've learned that everything in life has its price
2939,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
2940,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
2941,show the times for animated movies in the nearest movie house
2942,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
2943,the mixture took on a reddish color almost the color of blood
2944,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
2945,an alchemist said the alchemist
2946,and also because i know about the soul of the world he thought to himself
2947,i'll take mine now
2948,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
2949,the boy awoke before dawn
2950,would you like to see where i was tattooed
2951,it seems old and wise
2952,what's from the governor
2953,when you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win
2954,this is what was written on the emerald tablet said the alchemist when he had finished
2955,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
2956,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
2957,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
2958,then the thing came upon him in a flash
2959,but maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language
2960,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
2961,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
2962,the sun is friendly right now but it will turn on us and consume this planet
2963,the boy awoke as the sun rose
2964,it was a tent like many at the oasis
2965,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
2966,the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
2967,so the boy was disappointed he decided that he would never again believe in dreams
2968,in those times the master work could be written simply on an emerald
2969,something just flew by
2970,they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
2971,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
2972,let me comb your hair
2973,but she hadn't charged him anything
2974,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
2975,a poor little fellow that never meant nobody no harm
2976,my greatgrandfather planted this tree
2977,who told you about omens the boy's interest was increasing by the moment
2978,fatima is a woman of the desert said the alchemist
2979,you would have to have been born an arab to understand he answered
2980,i heard a faint movement under my feet
2981,that's what i did before i married charles
2982,flaring torches were filling the dungeon with an ambient noise
2983,the sparrow and the songbird danced along the fence
2984,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
2985,this wasn't a strange place it was a new one
2986,it's a good thing i got here in time
2987,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
2988,the book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists
2989,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
2990,he tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones
2991,four hundred and fifty dollars
2992,fifty cents on the dollar
2993,they locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold had
2994,one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
2995,whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
2996,it's always nice if you can learn something new isn't it
2997,i've got to decorate my tree
2998,just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
2999,roger the backup team is on the way
3000,it drew a droplet of blood
3001,the brake fluid was leaking out onto the path
3002,then the thing came upon him in a flash
3003,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
3004,melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
3005,i told him we could teach her to ignore people who waste her time
3006,on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
3007,hunches his mother used to call them
3008,go into your dance
3009,darren never saw a bottle till he was six months old
3010,the boy stepped closer to the girl and when she smiled he did the same
3011,the boy was shocked
3012,it looked like a rusty gas float
3013,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
3014,the englishman was disappointed
3015,tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse
3016,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
3017,i'm a woman of the desert she said averting her face
3018,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
3019,when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
3020,you don't call this a convenience
3021,they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had
3022,but i like it that way
3023,it was only words
3024,the internet should reflect all of the people who use it
3025,it was our money and we want it back
3026,and he told what he had seen
3027,what do you know about this
3028,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
3029,that's why i'm an angel second class
3030,he walked slowly through the market
3031,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
3032,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
3033,i heard a faint movement under my feet
3034,one minute to go
3035,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
3036,because you are trying to realize your destiny
3037,but instead of being saddened he was happy
3038,i don't want to take any chances
3039,all you've got to do is talk to him
3040,that's why i keep losing
3041,and you can quote me on that
3042,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
3043,its important to keep an open mind and she has urged me to do the same
3044,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
3045,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
3046,but he kept the sword in his hand
3047,because i don't love him
3048,yet it was a little too large for assurance
3049,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
3050,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
3051,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
3052,all i want to do is be let alone
3053,she never told her that
3054,servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
3055,they all complain they're practically working for the government
3056,he placed urim and thummim in the chest
3057,listen to your heart
3058,why should i be in any danger
3059,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
3060,it's not i the wind spoke about
3061,i shall make us some ice cubes
3062,when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
3063,the boy felt ill and terribly alone
3064,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
3065,the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
3066,they're not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia
3067,let's call him up
3068,he took the fourth part and handed it to the monk
3069,he took out one of the stones
3070,the levanter increased in intensity
3071,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
3072,there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
3073,he said that everything has its own destiny
3074,i gotta figure some way out of this thing
3075,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
3076,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
3077,all the birds began to sing at the first light of dawn
3078,the boy had met the alchemist
3079,it's a beautiful miracle
3080,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
3081,shame on you and get off my front porch
3082,there's nobody else on the paper who can write
3083,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
3084,and she already has her treasure it's you
3085,those are the rules of war the leader explained
3086,the boy felt ill and terribly alone
3087,bush leagues mostly
3088,came to the bar he had entered on his first day there
3089,the world speaks many languages the boy thought
3090,are you sure you're comfortable
3091,henderson was taking it in
3092,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
3093,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
3094,and at that i told him and he took my place
3095,benjamin was snacking on strips of bacon
3096,the boy was relieved
3097,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
3098,they wanted to save the oasis
3099,are you really fred's brother
3100,one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
3101,in those times the master work could be written simply on an emerald
3102,and one or two persons were returning
3103,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
3104,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
3105,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
3106,but we could sell tea in crystal glasses
3107,that's never happened to me the boy said
3108,my chinchilla eats bread
3109,the alchemist dismounted slowly and the boy did the same
3110,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
3111,i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled
3112,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
3113,give me the district attorney's office
3114,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
3115,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
3116,sort of a jack london style
3117,when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
3118,now im scared of what is inside of pies
3119,are children more creative than adults
3120,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
3121,i'm doing everything humanly possible
3122,it's called the principle of favorability
3123,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
3124,then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy
3125,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
3126,of course the two were unable to do anything
3127,everything has been written by the same hand
3128,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
3129,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
3130,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
3131,what difference does it make what time it is
3132,the usage of high information content is meaningless
3133,what is an alchemist he asked finally
3134,when i'm eating that's all i think about
3135,more good luck telegrams
3136,i don't know the desert that well yet
3137,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
3138,you've been doing mighty good work lately
3139,when the lead had become liquid the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg
3140,you sure nothing's missing
3141,maybe it was because they moved around so much
3142,i'm the leader of the caravan said a darkeyed bearded man
3143,in my fantasy i can guarantee harmony for all eternity
3144,it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
3145,let him have everything he wants
3146,nope not going unless they have a giant inflatable slide
3147,the letter from kelsey jane
3148,what idiot wrote this total drivel
3149,the cover of the magazine showed a cute puppy
3150,i've already told you
3151,i am following my destiny
3152,it was just that he couldn't grasp what it meant
3153,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
3154,the alchemist rode in front with the falcon on his shoulder
3155,more good luck telegrams
3156,some storms are worth the wreckage
3157,was the doctor here
3158,the greatest yarn ever written by anybody
3159,and one can always come back
3160,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
3161,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
3162,there were snickers from the background
3163,you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
3164,you seem to think i've never done this before
3165,but i was also stumbling because i couldnt look away from these things
3166,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
3167,opening the source code can be a measure to create trust in software
3168,many of whom are homeless and hungry
3169,the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
3170,they rode for the entire day
3171,i would if i thought i'd hear anything worth listening to
3172,and the falcon then nourishes man
3173,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
3174,because you are trying to realize your destiny
3175,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
3176,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
3177,that man is terrific
3178,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
3179,i was impatient to see it opened
3180,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
3181,he offered the kids some icecream
3182,i'm not supposed to tell
3183,since then i haven't been able to get another one
3184,how long is it
3185,so the wind blew with all its strength and the sky was filled with sand
3186,he got up early with the idea of finding it
3187,there's that reprieve if they ever find out
3188,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
3189,you'll weaken when you see that little jezebel
3190,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
3191,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
3192,the night was warm and i was thirsty
3193,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
3194,the night was warm and i was thirsty
3195,this was a lie and they all knew it
3196,their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand
3197,so you can kill me too
3198,spotted dick is a classic british pudding
3199,because the crystal was dirty
3200,the boy stepped closer to the girl and when she smiled he did the same
3201,the accommodation was affordable and cosy
3202,the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
3203,everywhere there were stalls with items for sale
3204,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
3205,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
3206,what do you want me to do
3207,i should have repeated it for him
3208,once to the thief and once to the general
3209,how about a little service
3210,henderson was taking it in
3211,it's not so bad
3212,not what you'd call rich
3213,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
3214,the woman said she had never heard of such a person and hurried away
3215,we felt that something was following us through the woods
3216,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
3217,maybe that's why they give up on it so early too
3218,here's some cheese you like
3219,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
3220,what's going on here
3221,will i learn to do that someday the boy asked
3222,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
3223,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
3224,you can't do that to me
3225,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
3226,nearby was the englishman reading a book
3227,the whole police force standing on it's ear
3228,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
3229,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
3230,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
3231,i'll never get this speech right
3232,you couldn't get a bigger bed in here though
3233,he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
3234,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
3235,but nowhere could he find his new companion
3236,he got up early with the idea of finding it
3237,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
3238,it seemed so safe and tranquil
3239,that makes sense the alchemist answered
3240,he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
3241,there was a full moon and the boy told the englishman the story of his life
3242,i don't want to rush you
3243,what's for dinner tonight
3244,as if i had the money back in a safe
3245,an hour later he had before him a chest of spanish gold coins
3246,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
3247,but she said nothing
3248,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
3249,there were mountains in the distance
3250,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
3251,i don't blame them
3252,i know why i want to get back to my flock he thought
3253,your dentist called yesterday
3254,i was wondering if you would work on this project with me because i cant find anyone else
3255,but now i'm sad and alone
3256,would you show these gentlemen to the door
3257,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
3258,the sea has lived on in this shell because that's its destiny
3259,everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
3260,then suddenly they kneel and die
3261,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
3262,i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
3263,he got up early with the idea of finding it
3264,better let me talk to him
3265,the ivy climbed up the building and wrapped itself around the chimney
3266,that sobered him a little
3267,kate frank's a baker
3268,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
3269,i'll be back in a minute
3270,he began to dig at the base of the sycamore
3271,that's right said the old man able to read the boy's thoughts
3272,he was learning a lot of new things
3273,i shall make us some ice cubes
3274,why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
3275,but when the reign of tiberius ended his poems were forgotten
3276,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
3277,i don't understand what you're talking about the desert said
3278,at the camp it was difficult to see anything
3279,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
3280,if someone isn't what others want them to be the others become angry
3281,wear the blue one
3282,i can't do that
3283,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
3284,of course it's the place
3285,get me walter burns
3286,now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
3287,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
3288,he was immensely excited at the news
3289,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
3290,she likes you well enough to stick around
3291,i've got to talk to you straight from the shoulder
3292,what does she look like
3293,the wind screamed with delight and blew harder than ever
3294,and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
3295,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
3296,one by one the campfires were extinguished and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert
3297,he had already seen many people come and go and the desert remained as it was
3298,that sobered him a little
3299,i'm going to tell her what i think of her
3300,he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
3301,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
3302,henderson was taking it in
3303,people talk a lot about omens thought the shepherd
3304,don't be a fool
3305,don't hurt my finger again
3306,until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
3307,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
3308,as he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason
3309,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
3310,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
3311,the boy was also saddened his friend was in pursuit of his destiny
3312,it always helps to be learning something new and exciting
3313,i'm going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me
3314,i'll make such a mess of things without you
3315,the train pulled into the station
3316,people from all over the world have passed through this village son said his father
3317,sometimes their caravan met with another
3318,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
3319,you'll marry fatima and you'll both be happy for a year
3320,everything on earth is being continuously transformed because the earth is alive
3321,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
3322,and they attacked an empty tent
3323,some storms are worth the wreckage
3324,before this i always looked to the desert with longing said fatima
3325,have a good look
3326,then like a colony of worker ants they dismantled their stalls and left
3327,some went away while i was there and other people came
3328,i felt a chill down my spine
3329,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
3330,the scottish parliament contains politicians
3331,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
3332,makes about five thousand a year
3333,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
3334,i'm at the end of my rope
3335,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
3336,how do you expect me to get any work done
3337,a practice of infidels he said to himself
3338,here's some cheese you like
3339,let's have your story
3340,he told her about the morning's meeting
3341,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
3342,then suddenly they kneel and die
3343,from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
3344,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
3345,out with larry's deputies
3346,i'll see that she gets the flowers
3347,you'll marry fatima and you'll both be happy for a year
3348,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
3349,i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
3350,where are they gone
3351,it has happened many times before
3352,just for the first year
3353,haven't you even started
3354,i'll show you what i'm doing
3355,that's rather big talk
3356,you can't believe it's not butter
3357,on the third day the chief met with his officers
3358,she composed an emotional song in her bedroom
3359,do you understand that
3360,how'd you get out
3361,once this is done deepspeech can be used to train a highquality open source recognition engine
3362,what else are you
3363,when she saw the unknown object bobbing up and down the edge she was absolutely horrified
3364,oh they're laughing at me
3365,somehow the paragraphs blurred into each other
3366,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
3367,you're right when you say my father was no business man
3368,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
3369,the englishman was disappointed
3370,i'll talk to you tonight
3371,the trade union was negotiating higher loans with the other stakeholders
3372,this is a common misconception sheldon said
3373,who wants to see liver pills
3374,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
3375,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
3376,i'm going with you the boy said
3377,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
3378,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
3379,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
3380,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
3381,want to give my flower a drink
3382,there was a shimmering green light emanating from the statue
3383,were you paid for it or weren't you
3384,i don't know you from adam
3385,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
3386,he didn't consider mending the hole  the stones could fall through any time they wanted
3387,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
3388,i just wanted to be sure
3389,she needs to get her transcripts and passport first
3390,three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
3391,i haven't been able to shake him since
3392,he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
3393,the old man was probably a gypsy too
3394,lots of places sell tea around here the merchant said
3395,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
3396,these are the spies said one of the men
3397,but that's the jail
3398,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
3399,this convention's gonna cost plenty
3400,he proposed a solution
3401,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
3402,now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
3403,johnathan assessed the situation carefully
3404,that's all mark ever talks about
3405,the vision vanished immediately but it had shaken him
3406,because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
3407,the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
3408,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
3409,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
3410,first he had studied esperanto then the world's religions and now it was alchemy
3411,what am i doing
3412,it was engineering at its finest
3413,because the crystal was dirty
3414,from that day on it was the desert that would be important
3415,the boy prodded them one by one with his crook calling each by name
3416,another person was there to help him toward his destiny
3417,i'll phone them right away to get that story
3418,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
3419,i myself heard nothing of that
3420,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
3421,in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
3422,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
3423,when he was a child that man wanted to travel too
3424,i have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time
3425,all things are one
3426,the townsfolk were all chumps
3427,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
3428,she has the most lovely smile i have ever seen
3429,we're in no hurry the chief answered
3430,the brake fluid was leaking out onto the path
3431,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
3432,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
3433,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
3434,you can't talk to her like that though
3435,like an old fire horse
3436,of course there is
3437,yet it was a little too large for assurance
3438,saved us another building
3439,he believed in omens
3440,my review of the sun one star
3441,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
3442,saved us another building
3443,its lower end was still embedded
3444,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
3445,sam's crazy about mick
3446,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
3447,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
3448,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
3449,you can find it here or linked from the navigation sidebar on every page
3450,i have a taxi waiting downstairs
3451,i'm afraid the joke's on us
3452,been seeing me in your dreams
3453,i'm also going back to paris today
3454,melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
3455,you've got just ten minutes
3456,he really was a king
3457,get your guns out
3458,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
3459,he disappeared into the tent
3460,we beat the whole country on that story
3461,sodium chloride is just common table salt
3462,sam's crazy about mick
3463,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
3464,he was excited and at the same time uneasy maybe the girl had already forgotten him
3465,you'd think i was on the witness stand
3466,the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
3467,what're you trying to do
3468,and one or two persons were returning
3469,you know where i live
3470,life attracts life the alchemist answered
3471,the things that pop up at the last minute
3472,i don't know how to find life in the desert the boy said
3473,one must prepare for it
3474,a boy came running towards me
3475,everything i do is friendly
3476,i don't care what you say
3477,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
3478,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
3479,the conspiracy nuts will love this
3480,why can't you be serious
3481,until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
3482,the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
3483,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
3484,i'd love to see you try and convince them of that
3485,what's the idea of locking this
3486,then it became a signal of danger
3487,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
3488,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
3489,where is the treasure he asked
3490,so that was it
3491,better bring me a glass of milk
3492,he saw that fatima's eyes were filled with tears
3493,they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
3494,then one day the boy returned the books to the englishman
3495,she learned how to play the piano in a music school
3496,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
3497,you killed all three of them for nothing
3498,he was learning a lot of new things
3499,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
3500,is much less sensitive to spurious awakenings than the sleep mode
3501,the sheep had taught him that
3502,i was just going to
3503,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
3504,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
3505,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
3506,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
3507,that's what i'm going to do
3508,most meteorites are more or less rounded
3509,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
3510,did you hear what i said
3511,the criminals taunted the police officers and prison guards
3512,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
3513,i myself heard nothing of that
3514,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
3515,but the boy was certain that he had been looking at them
3516,you got plenty of money
3517,but the merchant understood what the boy had said
3518,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
3519,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
3520,how many people do you think will be there
3521,come on with that money
3522,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
3523,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
3524,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
3525,i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance
3526,i'm still having trouble with baking
3527,the boy was surprised at his thoughts
3528,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
3529,can't they see it's a frame up
3530,is sheriff helen in there
3531,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
3532,it has happened many times before
3533,this is for the boy
3534,he restarted his efforts for the twentieth time
3535,don't listen to that
3536,he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
3537,you can't go any farther one of them said
3538,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
3539,because they're still here
3540,at once he connected the two incidents
3541,the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn't matter
3542,maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
3543,divers found a dead person in the lake
3544,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
3545,here's two thousand dollars
3546,but bakers are more important people than shepherds
3547,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
3548,they're forming clubs
3549,but they could never have taught him arabic
3550,we've been taken for a lot of suckers
3551,where's ashley's wallet
3552,they're starting to throw things
3553,so how will we name all these hurricanes
3554,so you got married
3555,you should never cross the street when the traffic light shows red
3556,the streamer of gas came out towards us
3557,they both spoke the same language
3558,why didn't i call you back
3559,i want to talk to you
3560,he had found where his treasure was and was frightened at what might happen
3561,you got your sea legs yet
3562,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
3563,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
3564,it seemed so safe and tranquil
3565,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
3566,there were three hundred wells fifty thousand date trees and innumerable colored tents spread among them
3567,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
3568,the alchemist turned to the boy
3569,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
3570,suddenly the monster disappeared
3571,a boy came running towards me
3572,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
3573,he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
3574,some went away while i was there and other people came
3575,who told you that asked the boy startled
3576,and then he perceived it very slowly
3577,listen to that mob
3578,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
3579,the fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard
3580,go on out and get rid of it
3581,i'll have ned write it up
3582,she wrote the stuff
3583,the irish man sipped his tea
3584,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
3585,experts of geology agree yesterday's tsunami was just a herald of the imminent apocalypse
3586,whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
3587,at this hour of the morning
3588,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
3589,make room for mrs chelsea
3590,you don't know who did it
3591,he just got a new kite for his birthday
3592,last time i made the mistake of replicating a drawing by rodin
3593,please bring mama back
3594,got to get some practice
3595,casper predicted the outcome
3596,the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
3597,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
3598,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
3599,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
3600,tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse
3601,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
3602,i'm going home and see my wife and family
3603,you can have as many babies as you like
3604,the man wept with happiness
3605,he couldn't have been wrong
3606,the world speaks many languages the boy thought
3607,the one in there
3608,he doesn't have anything else
3609,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
3610,they went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set
3611,the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
3612,it was a a kind of fascination that paralysed my actions
3613,this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
3614,let us in on it
3615,even then he hardly understood what this meant
3616,the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange
3617,i've been to your house a hundred times
3618,the boy was relieved
3619,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
3620,it is i who dared to do so said the boy
3621,curse the moment i met that old man he thought
3622,it's all right if you want to smoke your cigar now
3623,the boy was shaking with fear but the alchemist helped him out of the tent
3624,what's she up to
3625,what did you stop it for
3626,he told her about the morning's meeting
3627,do you realize what you've done
3628,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
3629,mark untaped the package carefully
3630,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
3631,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
3632,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
3633,i have already found my treasure
3634,the boy was shocked
3635,it spoke of journeys discoveries books and change
3636,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
3637,the navy's going to fly father home this afternoon
3638,i myself heard nothing of that
3639,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
3640,the boy stood up shakily and looked once more at the pyramids
3641,and the solid part was called the philosopher's stone
3642,i'm not working for any other paper
3643,it seemed so safe and tranquil
3644,and it knew nothing about love
3645,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
3646,i have a taxi waiting downstairs
3647,you're just like father used to be
3648,make you're a hero sure as you're born
3649,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
3650,have trusted more in your love for fatima
3651,there must be a language that doesn't depend on words the boy thought
3652,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
3653,it's the emerald tablet said the englishman proud that he might teach something to the boy
3654,the streamer of gas came out towards us
3655,so his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon
3656,the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
3657,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
3658,i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought
3659,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
3660,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
3661,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
3662,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
3663,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
3664,the boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker
3665,her father's awful worried about her
3666,you should evaluate it in a perceptual experiment
3667,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
3668,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
3669,many of our soldiers teamed up
3670,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
3671,'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
3672,the boy thought about the crystal merchant
3673,there was no other baggage
3674,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
3675,it was a tent like many at the oasis
3676,he decided to concentrate on more practical matters
3677,did you invite him to the concert
3678,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
3679,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
3680,the walls were covered with a thick paste
3681,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
3682,who told you about omens the boy's interest was increasing by the moment
3683,you're not going anywhere
3684,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
3685,march was windy and dark
3686,they tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them
3687,they become the soul o f the world
3688,what's your first name
3689,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
3690,can i get a woot woot
3691,a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop
3692,something terrible's happened to me
3693,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
3694,if a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know
3695,for the best part of its life the table has been standing in the basement
3696,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
3697,what about this job
3698,the boy became fearful the omens told him that something was wrong
3699,they were his treasure
3700,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
3701,the medical industry saves lives
3702,if i don't find it i can always go home
3703,don't you know that girl's very sick
3704,many telescopes were pointed at it
3705,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
3706,never advertise razors by shaving a monkey it's cruel and results in lawsuits
3707,wait for the end of the war
3708,the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
3709,what he said reminded the boy of the old king
3710,they set off running wildly into the trees
3711,jitterbugs john and the colonel
3712,but the boy couldn't even speak
3713,i'm smoking too much
3714,john catherine topped them all
3715,he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
3716,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
3717,who's got the room next to hers
3718,doesn't that make sense
3719,given only the public key it is very hard to compute the private one
3720,but he still couldn't flee
3721,to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
3722,that's a lot of hooey
3723,too bad he has to be fed on a bottle
3724,i'm going to them
3725,he doesn't have anything else
3726,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
3727,we are part of that soul so we rarely recognize that it is working for us
3728,their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand
3729,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
3730,and to do that you need money
3731,drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the boy was feeling happier
3732,and at that i told him and he took my place
3733,alfayoum is in egypt said the arab
3734,we know that and we are used to it
3735,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
3736,there's gold here he said
3737,motion parallax is a monocular depth cue
3738,in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
3739,the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
3740,yet it was a little too large for assurance
3741,who told you about omens the boy's interest was increasing by the moment
3742,i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled
3743,the meeting was over
3744,they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
3745,it spoke of journeys discoveries books and change
3746,love is the force that transforms and improves the soul of the world
3747,lighthouses in a foggy world
3748,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
3749,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
3750,this will help you effectively collaborate with developers and coordinate crossteam projects throughout your career
3751,he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
3752,she just stepped out
3753,but he appeared to be unaware of any danger
3754,the camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing the sunset
3755,we'll have something to drink and eat these hawks
3756,i can't think of any enemies i have
3757,i'll be back the boy said
3758,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
3759,too much food is being wasted
3760,maybe they're like me
3761,there was a loud shriek from a woman standing behind us
3762,that's why i'm here in the middle of het desert
3763,it sounded like a gypsy prayer
3764,did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create
3765,i believe what she said
3766,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
3767,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
3768,the next thing the dope wants is a room
3769,that baker he said to himself without completing the thought
3770,her eye twitched uncontrollably
3771,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
3772,rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
3773,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
3774,you can only spit out so many seeds
3775,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
3776,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
3777,here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
3778,from there he could see africa in the distance
3779,put jackie right on the staff
3780,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
3781,the football jocks laughed viciously
3782,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
3783,no sense in going up there
3784,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
3785,but just before lunchtime a boy stopped in front of the shop
3786,continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
3787,they dismounted and the alchemist said nothing
3788,all things are one the boy thought
3789,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
3790,has aunt stephanie come in yet
3791,sorry but i'm allergic to that
3792,let's go hiking across france
3793,the basketball bounced off his shield of titanium
3794,the sun began its departure as well
3795,but he granted the travelers three days
3796,they went in to drink the tea which was served in beautiful crystal glasses
3797,he wanted your money he said
3798,lindsey promised to call you from new york tonight
3799,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
3800,can you imagine bumping into a load of cops
3801,she had pneumonia once
3802,anita passed out during gymnastics she recovered quickly
3803,when the judge spoke the death sentence the defendant showed no emotion
3804,white washed walls drive me mad
3805,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
3806,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
3807,at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
3808,he could sell the stones and buy a return ticket
3809,he placed urim and thummim in the chest
3810,where is the treasure he asked
3811,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
3812,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
3813,well why don't we go there right now the boy asked
3814,but now the sounds inside had stopped
3815,look at it today
3816,he wasn't asking for help
3817,you lived your life in a loving way and died with dignity
3818,the little girl wanted to have a balloon but was too shy to ask
3819,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
3820,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
3821,what's the matter with eleanor
3822,that rollercoaster was insane
3823,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
3824,don't you know that girl's very sick
3825,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
3826,then suddenly they kneel and die
3827,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
3828,and he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals
3829,i jumped in to save rachel
3830,the boy said nothing
3831,you didn't vote for me the last time
3832,can i do something cassie
3833,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
3834,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
3835,tux is not smiling he just looks nice all the time
3836,you'll weaken when you see that little jezebel
3837,it almost retained its shape
3838,we'll get you out in ten minutes
3839,the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
3840,the boy didn't say anything
3841,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
3842,just tell them marge sent you
3843,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
3844,they could barely see the boy
3845,just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
3846,what have you done with my keys
3847,he doesn't have anything else
3848,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
3849,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
3850,you could have married anybody else in town
3851,but they were not there
3852,i have known true alchemists the alchemist continued
3853,we'll be down with the bags in a minute
3854,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
3855,where do you live
3856,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
3857,some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other
3858,come here a minute
3859,i was impatient to see it opened
3860,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
3861,when the sun sets the men will once again surrender their arms to me
3862,his arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the hole
3863,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
3864,he took out his money and counted it
3865,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
3866,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
3867,i needed immediate access
3868,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
3869,i've had this shop for thirty years
3870,but you want to know something
3871,tap on the circle to escape
3872,you dont compare directly to existing stateoftheart methods
3873,i've learned things from the sheep and i've learned things from crystal he thought
3874,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
3875,at once he connected the two incidents
3876,maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
3877,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
3878,can i help you asked the man behind the window
3879,the soul of the world is nourished by people's happiness
3880,i'm proud of it
3881,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
3882,then came the night of the first falling star
3883,it's a dream in the language of the world she said
3884,but they've got nothing to do with this case
3885,she's written to me every day since
3886,he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
3887,give me my book the boy said
3888,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
3889,is it all right
3890,it was the pure language of the world
3891,it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
3892,i forgot you were here
3893,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
3894,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
3895,some went away while i was there and other people came
3896,it has happened many times before
3897,you can't trust anybody in this crazy world
3898,the shepherd swore that he would
3899,i'll have it in a minute
3900,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
3901,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
3902,she'll see us through dinner
3903,the deranged developer revised his application source code after a careful study of its contents
3904,and at that i told him and he took my place
3905,then came the night of the first falling star
3906,it gave a peculiarly sharp cry
3907,read all about it
3908,they could barely see the boy
3909,the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
3910,everything on earth is being continuously transformed because the earth is alive
3911,but coding without a mouse or a keyboard
3912,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
3913,other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs
3914,the burning fire had been extinguished
3915,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
3916,the camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing the sunset
3917,even when all you want to do is travel
3918,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
3919,on the second day the boy climbed to the top of a cliff near the camp
3920,all ways led to the same destination
3921,they have searched it thoroughly
3922,they were tribesmen dressed in blue with black rings surrounding their turbans
3923,are you all right
3924,but the boy couldn't even speak
3925,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
3926,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
3927,she composed an emotional song in her bedroom
3928,his father said no more
3929,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
3930,you'll watch them as they grow demonstrating how the world is always changing
3931,he remembered the sword
3932,the alchemist stopped abruptly and bent to the ground
3933,all new generations of gpus support tesselation in hardware
3934,but finally the merchant appeared and asked the boy to shear four sheep
3935,he placed the dvd into the player
3936,and they attacked an empty tent
3937,it's a dream in the language of the world she said
3938,he wasn't an alchemist
3939,two horsemen waiting ahead of them
3940,the boy smiled to himself
3941,i turned and as i did so the screw must have fallen out
3942,and that other honeymoon in a coal mine
3943,that's a lot of gold
3944,he remembered the sword
3945,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
3946,he disappeared into the tent
3947,on the third day the chief met with his officers
3948,i'm trying to explain to my mother how to get pictures off her phone
3949,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
3950,and ask for a glass of wine for me
3951,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
3952,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
3953,the boy swore that every time he heard the alarm he would heed its message
3954,sausages croquettes and broccoli are our meal in the canteen today
3955,the immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster
3956,i wished i had a light to smoke by
3957,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
3958,save that for the tribune
3959,a practice of infidels he said to himself
3960,some went away while i was there and other people came
3961,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
3962,glad he took the t out of that
3963,so you got married
3964,i don't know you
3965,a part of me is also trying to come to terms with the fact that i won't be able to travel as much anymore
3966,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
3967,i'd like to take a bath
3968,at the camp it was difficult to see anything
3969,but i sort of like him
3970,everything you need to know you have learned through your journey
3971,he's on my phone
3972,maybe the alchemist has never been in love the boy thought
3973,i was just thinking of a flaming rum punch
3974,she used her microscope to inspect it
3975,the planet's core is made of solid gold but every traveller attempting to recover some didn't return
3976,we've got her located
3977,enough said the boy
3978,you can't believe it's not butter
3979,she has all your features
3980,i've got to see nicole right away
3981,what are these things he asked
3982,so the boy was disappointed he decided that he would never again believe in dreams
3983,i can't imagine who did it
3984,but there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken
3985,they don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change
3986,you can't be the wind the wind said
3987,the arabs laughed at him and the alchemist laughed along
3988,he has done so much ghostwriting that he starts to feel like a ghost too
3989,i'm playing for keeps
3990,the old man opened his cape and the boy was struck by what he saw
3991,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
3992,at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
3993,he told them all to be seated
3994,the restaurant was quite expensive
